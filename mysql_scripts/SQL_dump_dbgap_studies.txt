In addition to collecting natural history data, AREDS    included a clinical trial of high-dose vitamin and mineral supplements for AMD and a clinical trial of high-dose vitamin supplements    for cataract. AREDS participants were 55 to 80 years of age at enrollment and had to be free of any illness or condition that would make    long-term follow-up or compliance with study medications unlikely or difficult. On the basis of fundus photographs graded by a    central reading center, best-corrected visual acuity and ophthalmologic evaluations, 4,757 participants were enrolled in one of several    AMD categories, including persons with no AMD.   </p>   <p>    The clinical trials for AMD and cataract were conducted concurrently. AREDS participants were followed on the clinical trials for a    median time of 6.5 years. Subsequent to the conclusion of the clinical trials, participants were followed for an additional 5 years    and natural history data were collected. The AREDS research design is detailed in AREDS Report 1. AREDS Report 8 contains the mainline    results from the AMD trial; AREDS Report 9 contains the results of the cataract trial.   </p>   <p>    Blood samples were also collected from 3,700+ AREDS participants for genetic research. Genetic samples from 600 AREDS participants    (200 controls, 200 Neovascular AMD cases, and 200 Geographic Atrophy cases) were selected using data available in March 2005 and then    were evaluated with a genome-wide scan. These data, as well as selected phenotypic data, were made available in the dbGaP. DNA from    AREDS participants, which is currently being stored in the AREDS Genetic Repository, is available for research purposes. However, not all    of the 3,700+ AREDS participants who submitted a blood sample currently have DNA available.   </p>   <p>    In addition to including the data from the genome-wide scan on the 600 original samples, this second version of the AREDS dbGaP    database provides a comprehensive set of data tables with extensive clinical information collected for the 4,757 participants who    participated in AREDS. The tables include information collected at enrollment/baseline, during study follow-up, fundus and lens pathology,    nutritional estimates, quality of life measures and measures of morbidity and mortality.   </p>   <p>In November 2010, over 72,000 high quality fundus and lens photographs from 595 AREDS participants (of the original 600    selected for the genome-wide scan) were made available in the AREDS dbGaP. In addition to the genome-wide scan data, the    fundus and lens grading data for these participants are also available in the AREDS dbGaP. Details about the ocular    photographs that are available are found <a href="GetPdf.cgi?id=phd003307.1" target="_blank">here</a>.   </p>   <p>   In January 2012, a measure of daily sunlight exposure was added in a separate &#34;sunlight&#34; table.  Furthermore, the &#34;followup&#34; table has been revised.     The visual acuity for the right eye was inadvertently missing at odd-numbered visits (01, 03, 05, etc.).  This data is now part of the table.   </p>   <p>    It is hoped that this resource will better help researchers understand two important diseases that affect an aging population. These data    may be applied to examination and inference on genetic and genetic-environmental bases for age-related diseases of public health    significance and may also help elucidate the clinical course of both conditions, generate hypotheses, and aid in the design of clinical    trials of preventive interventions.   </p><br/>    <p>    <b>Definitions of Final AMD Phenotype Categories</b><br/>    Please see <a href="GetPdf.cgi?id=phd001138" target="_blank">phd001138.1</a> for a detailed description of how AREDS participants&#39;    final AMD phenotype was categorized.   </p><br/>    <p>    <b>User&#39;s Guide for AREDS Phenotype Data</b><br/>    A detailed User&#39;s Guide for the AREDS phenotype data is available.

In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI) -- embarked on a novel and ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic.</p> <p>The objective of the FHS was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke.</p> <p><b>Design of Framingham Heart Study.</b> In 1948, the researchers recruited 5,209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later analyze for common patterns related to CVD development. Since 1948, the subjects have returned to the study every two years for an examination consisting of a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, and in 1971, the study enrolled a second-generation cohort -- 5,124 of the original participants&#39; adult children and their spouses -- to participate in similar examinations. The second examination of the Offspring cohort occurred eight years after the first examination, and subsequent examinations have occurred approximately every four years thereafter. In April 2002 the Study entered a new phase: the enrollment of a third generation of participants, the grandchildren of the original cohort. The first examination of the Third Generation Study was completed in July 2005 and involved 4,095 participants. Thus, the FHS has evolved into a prospective, community-based, three generation family study. The FHS is a joint project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Boston University.</p> <p><b>Research Areas in the Framingham Heart Study.</b> Over the years, careful monitoring of the FHS population has led to the identification of the major CVD risk factors -- high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity -- as well as a great deal of valuable information on the effects of related factors such as blood triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, age, gender, and psychosocial issues. Risk factors have been identified for the major components of CVD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, intermittent claudication, and heart failure. It is also clear from research in the FHS and other studies that substantial subclinical vascular disease occurs in the blood vessels, heart and brain that precedes clinical CVD. With recent advances in technology, the FHS has enhanced its research capabilities and capitalized on its inherent resources by the conduct of high resolution imaging to detect and quantify subclinical vascular disease in the major blood vessels, heart and brain. These studies have included ultrasound studies of the heart (echocardiography) and carotid arteries, computed tomography studies of the heart and aorta, and magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, heart, and aorta. Although the Framingham cohort is primarily white, the importance of the major CVD risk factors identified in this group have been shown in other studies to apply almost universally among racial and ethnic groups, even though the patterns of distribution may vary from group to group. In the past half century, the Study has produced approximately 1,200 articles in leading medical journals. The concept of CVD risk factors has become an integral part of the modern medical curriculum and has led to the development of effective treatment and preventive strategies in clinical practice.</p> <p>In addition to research studies focused on risk factors, subclinical CVD and clinically apparent CVD, Framingham investigators have also collaborated with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects involving some of the major chronic illnesses in men and women, including dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis, nutritional deficiencies, eye diseases, hearing disorders, and chronic obstructive lung diseases.</p> <p><b>Genetic Research in the Framingham Heart Study.</b> While pursuing the Study&#39;s established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators has expanded its research mission into the study of genetic factors underlying CVD and other disorders. Over the past two decades, DNA has been collected from blood samples and from immortalized cell lines obtained from Original Cohort participants, members of the Offspring Cohort and the Third Generation Cohort. Several large-scale genotyping projects have been conducted in the past decade. Genome-wide linkage analysis has been conducted using genotypes of approximately 400 microsatellite markers that have been completed in over 9,300 subjects in all three generations. Analyses using microsatellite markers completed in the original cohort and offspring cohorts have resulted in over 100 publications, including many publications from the Genetics Analysis Workshop 13. Several other recent collaborative projects have completed thousands of SNP genotypes for candidate gene regions in subsets of FHS subjects with available DNA. These projects include the Cardiogenomics Program of the NHLBI&#39;s Programs for Genomics Applications, the genotyping of ~3000 SNPs in inflammation genes, and the completion of a genome-wide scan of 100,000 SNPs using the Affymetrix 100K Genechip.</p> <p><b>Framingham Cohort Phenotype Data.</b> The phenotype database contains a vast array of phenotype information available in all three generations. These will include the quantitative measures of the major risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, and cigarette use, as well as anthropomorphic measures such as body mass index, biomarkers such as fibrinogen and CRP, and electrocardiography measures such as the QT interval. Many of these measures have been collected repeatedly in the original and offspring cohorts. Also included in the SHARe database will be an array of recently collected biomarkers, subclinical disease imaging measures, clinical CVD outcomes as well as an array of ancillary studies.

The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to addiction through a large-scale genome-wide   association study of DSM-IV alcohol dependent (and frequently illicit drug dependent) cases and non-dependent, unrelated control   subjects of European and African American descent.</p>   <p>The focus of this proposal is a case-control design of unrelated individuals for a genetic association study of addiction.  Cases   are defined as individuals with DSM-IV alcohol dependence (lifetime) and potentially other illicit drug dependence. In addition to the   categorical diagnosis, we have data on ordinal measurements of number of DSM-IV symptoms for alcohol, nicotine, marijuana,   cocaine, opiates and other drugs so that we will able to construct quantitative measurements of addiction severity over a wide   range of substances.  Controls are defined as individuals who have been exposed to alcohol (and possibly to other drugs), but   have never met lifetime diagnosis for alcohol dependence or dependence on other illicit substances.  Analyses that include   refinement of the phenotype and incorporation of important demographic and environmental factors into association   studies will be pursued.</p>   <p>Cases and controls were selected from three large, complementary datasets: the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA),   the Family Study of Cocaine Dependence (FSCD), and the Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND).</p>   <p><b><u>COGA:</u></b> COGA was initiated in 1989 and is a large-scale family study that has had as its primary aim the identification of genes   that contribute to alcoholism susceptibility and related characteristics.  COGA is funded through the National Institute   on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA).  Subjects were recruited from 7 sites across the U.S. Alcohol dependent probands   were recruited from treatment facilities and assessed by personal interview.  After securing permission, other family   members were also assessed. A set of comparison families was drawn from the same communities as the   families recruited through the alcohol dependent probands. Assessment involved a comprehensive personal interview developed for this   project, the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA), which gathers detailed information on alcoholism   related symptoms along with other drugs and psychiatric symptoms. Families with three or more first-degree relatives who were   alcohol dependent were invited for more extensive testing, including neurophysiology evaluations (ERPs and EEGs) and a battery   of neuropsychological assessments.  Blood was obtained for genetic studies. Institutional Review Boards at all sites approved the   protocols, including sharing in the NIAAA national repository.</p>   <p>COGA has four Co-Principal Investigators Bernice Porjesz, Victor Hesselbrock, Howard Edenberg, and Laura Bierut. COGA   includes nine different centers where data collection, analysis, and storage take place. The nine sites and Principal Investigators and    Co-investigators are: University of Connecticut (Victor Hesselbrock); Indiana University (Howard Edenberg, John Nurnberger, Jr.,    Tatiana Foroud); University of Iowa (Samuel Kuperman); SUNY Downstate (Bernice Porjesz); Washington University in St. Louis    (Laura Bierut, Alison Goate, John Rice); University of California at San Diego (Marc Schuckit); Howard University (Robert Taylor);    Rutgers University (Jay Tischfield); Southwest Foundation (Laura Almasy). Q. Max Guo serves as the NIAAA Staff Collaborator. This    national collaborative study is supported by the NIH Grant U10AA008401 from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism    (NIAAA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).</p>   <p><b><u>Family Study of Cocaine Dependence (FSCD):</u></b> This project was initiated in 2000 as a case-control family study of   cocaine dependence funded through the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA; PI: Laura Bierut).  The primary goal was to increase the   understanding of the familial and non-familial antecedents and consequences of cocaine dependence.  Cocaine dependent individuals were   systematically recruited from chemical dependency treatment units (both public and private; residential and outpatient) in the greater   St. Louis metropolitan area.  Community based control subjects were identified through a Missouri Driver&#39;s License Registry   (maintained at Washington University for research purposes) and matched by age, race, gender, and residential zip code.  As a supplement   to this project, blood samples were collected for future genetic analysis and were included in the NIDA Genetics Consortium.   Phenotypic data, DNA, and cell lines are in the NIDA Center for Genetics Studies.</p>   <p><b><u>Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND):</u></b> COGEND was initiated in 2001 as a three-part program   project grant funded through the National Cancer Institute (NCI; PI: Laura Bierut).  The three projects included a study of the familial   transmission of nicotine dependence, a genetic study of nicotine dependence, and a study of the relationship of nicotine dependence   with nicotine metabolism. The primary goal is to detect, localize, and characterize genes that predispose or protect an individual   with respect to heavy tobacco consumption, nicotine dependence, and related phenotypes and to integrate these findings with the family   transmission and nicotine metabolism findings. The primary design is a community based case-control family study. All subjects were   recruited from Detroit and St. Louis.  Nicotine dependent cases and non-dependent smoking controls were identified and recruited. In   addition, one sibling for each case and control subject was recruited in a subset of the sample. Over 56,000 subjects aged 25-44 years   were screened by telephone, over 3,100 subjects were personally interviewed, and over 2,900 donated blood samples for genetic studies.</p>   <p>All three studies (COGA, COGEND, FSCD) include measures of basic socio-demographic variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, family   income, educational attainment, religious participation, and family structure. Other important covariates and/or potential   moderators of genetic effects include comorbid addictions and age at initiation of use for cigarettes, alcohol   and drugs. The assessments also include measures of various life stressors, such as physical and sexual abuse, which have been implicated   in gene-environment interactions for several disorders. Coding for both individual variables and indices has been standardized across   studies. All subjects were assessed in person by trained research assistants.</p>   <p>Funding support for genotyping, which was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR),   was provided by the NIH GEI (U01HG004438), the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Institute on   Drug Abuse, and the NIH contract "High throughput genotyping for studying the genetic contributions to human disease"(HHSN268200782096C).</p>   <p><b>Note for Publications Related to Study:</b> The Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) has not yet generated publications.

Oral clefts have a complex and heterogeneous etiology, with strong evidence for  both genetic and environmental causal factors.  Candidate gene studies and genome wide linkage studies have yielded compelling  but inconsistent evidence that multiple genes control risk, and several studies have shown evidence for interaction between  genes and environmental exposures, especially maternal smoking and nutrient intake.  This consortium pulls together a  very large collection of cases and their parents from multiple populations, and offers a unique opportunity to expand  the search for genes controlling risk to the genome wide level.</p>  <p>The specific aims are:   <ol>    <li>To conduct a genome wide analysis on 2000+ case-parent trios ascertained through a case with isolated, non-syndromic    CL/P or CP to test for linkage and disequilibrium.  Initial analysis will consist of individual tests for gene effects    while simultaneously testing for GxE interaction with common maternal exposures including vitamin supplementation,    cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption (which have all been implicated as environmental risk factors for oral clefts).</li>    <li>To use haplotypes in tests for GxE interaction incorporating population specific estimates.  Since haplotype frequencies    vary among populations, trios will be assigned haplotypes in a stratified estimation and then a pooled test statistic will    be constructed.</li>    <li>To test for interaction between SNPs in different genes showing evidence of influencing risk in a test for GxG interaction.</li>    <li>To test for interaction between genes and maternal biomarkers using trios from Utah where measures of plasma folate,    vitamin B-6, homocysteine and zinc in mothers are available.</li>   </ol>  </p>  <p>This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative   (GENEVA, <a href="http://www.genevastudy.org" target="_blank">http://www.genevastudy.org</a>),   which was developed through the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI).

phs000095.v2.p1	Dental Caries GWAS	5418	Nuclear Families, Parent-Offspring Trios, Case-Control	Human610_Quadv1_B	GWAS	European American, African American	Both	\N	\N	<p>Dental caries (also known as tooth decay) remains the most common chronic disease of childhood, five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than environmental allergies, with more than 40% of children exhibiting caries when they enter kindergarten. In 2005, it was estimated that dental health care costs were approximately $84 billion, of which 60% or about $50 billion were related to treatment of dental caries. Although overall caries prevalence has declined over the last 40 years, dental caries in the primary dentition and mean caries rates in children ages 2-11 has increased markedly over the past 12 years. Childhood caries is a serious public health issue because of associated health problems and because disparities in oral health have led to substantially higher average disease prevalence among children in poverty and in under-served racial and ethnic groups. These issues are of such concern that in 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics made children&#39;s oral health one of their top areas of focus, as it is for the majority of the NIDCR "Disparities Centers".</p> <p>The etiology of dental caries has been studied for many years. Multiple factors contribute to a person&#39;s risk for caries, including: 1) environmental factors such as diet, oral hygiene, fluoride exposure and the level of colonization of cariogenic bacteria and 2) host factors such as salivary flow, salivary buffering capacity, position of teeth relative to each other, surface characteristics of tooth enamel and depth of occlusal fissures on posterior teeth. In spite of all that is known about this disease, there are still individuals who appear to be more susceptible to caries and those who are extremely resistant, regardless of the environmental risk factors to which they are exposed, implying that genetic factors also play an important role in caries etiology. This conclusion is supported by studies in both humans and animals, with the most compelling evidence coming from studies of twins reared apart in which investigators found significant resemblance within monozygotic (MZ) but not dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs for percentage of teeth and surfaces restored or carious and estimated the genetic contribution to caries as 40%. Other recent studies of twins reared together estimated the heritability for caries, adjusted for age and gender, as ranging from 45-64%.</p> <p>Despite the strong evidence of a genetic component to risk for dental caries, there have been only a few studies of candidate genes in caries, and no published genome-wide scans. A comprehensive genome wide search is the only approach that will allow us to identify those genetic regions likely to harbor genes increasing the risk for dental caries, and eventually to identify the etiologic genes and to explore the interaction of those genes with microbiological, dietary, fluoride, and behavioral factors that are known to be associated with caries risk and progression. <b>Therefore, the goal of this study is to perform genome-wide association (GWA) studies of dental caries with a large panel of SNP&#39;s (610,000) in families and individuals ascertained through multiple US sites (University of Pittsburgh and University of Iowa)</b>.</p> <p>The v2 release of this study includes 96 additional individuals who were genotyped with the CCDG: Dental Caries and CL/P in Guatemala project (dbGaP accession number <a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000440">phs000440</a>) to augment the data initially presented here.

For tier 1, we individually genotyped 198,345 uniformly spaced and informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 443 sibling pairs discordant for PD. For tier 2a, we individually genotyped 1,793 PD-associated SNPs (P&lt;.01 in tier 1) and 300 genomic control SNPs in 332 matched case-unrelated control pairs. We identified 11 SNPs that were associated with PD (P&lt;.01) in both tier 1 and tier 2 samples and had the same direction of effect. For these SNPs, we combined data from the case-unaffected sibling pair (tier 1) and case-unrelated control pair (tier 2) samples and employed a liberalization of the sibling transmission/disequilibrium test to calculate odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and P values. A SNP within the semaphorin 5A gene (SEMA5A) had the lowest combined P value (P=7.62E-6). The protein encoded by this gene plays an important role in neurogenesis and in neuronal apoptosis, which is consistent with existing hypotheses regarding PD pathogenesis. A second SNP tagged the PARK11 late-onset PD susceptibility locus (P=1.70E-5). In tier 2b, we also selected for genotyping additional SNPs that were borderline significant (P&lt;.05) in tier 1 but that tested a priori biological and genetic hypotheses regarding susceptibility to PD (n=941 SNPs). In analysis of the combined tier 1 and tier 2b data, the two SNPs with the lowest P values (P=9.07E-6; P=2.96E-5) tagged the PARK10 late-onset PD susceptibility locus. Independent replication across populations will clarify the role of the genomic loci tagged by these SNPs in conferring PD susceptibility.</p> <p>Note: The following instruments were used: 1)clinical assessments form and manual; 2) sibling screening form and manual; 3) unrelated control screening and manual; and 4) risk factors questionnaire and manual.

Fetal growth is determined  by complex interactions between fetal genes and the maternal uterine environment.  Subtle or overt variation in maternal  glucose tolerance, which is, in part, genetically determined, is related to fetal size at birth.  Moreover, new emerging data  suggest that genetic variation in the fetus can impact maternal metabolism (e.g., blood pressure and glucose tolerance).  Given  the above, we are addressing the hypothesis that, during pregnancy, gene-environment interactions in the context of the  maternal-fetal unit impact fetal size at birth and maternal metabolism.  Genes that control fetal growth or maternal metabolism  during pregnancy are largely unknown, so the first step to address our hypothesis will be to identify genetic variation that impacts  fetal growth and maternal metabolism and to determine the interaction of that variation with the intrauterine and fetal environment.</p>  <p>To accomplish this, we are performing genome wide association (GWA) mapping on a subset of ~37,000 DNA samples that were collected  from mothers and their offspring as part of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study.  HAPO is a multicenter,  international study in which high quality phenotypic data related to fetal growth and maternal glucose metabolism has been collected  from 25,000 pregnant women of varied racial and socio-demographic backgrounds using standardized protocols that were uniform across  centers.  For these studies, we are genotyping 1,500 infants and their mothers of European descent, 1,250 Afro-Caribbean infants and  mothers, 800 Hispanic (Mexican-American) infants and mothers, and 1200 Thai infants and mothers.  Genotyping is being performed    using the Illumina Human610 Quad (European ancestry participants), Human1M Duo (Afro-Caribbean and Hispanic participants), and    Omni1-Quad_v1-0_B (Thai participants).</p>  <p>The specific aims for the project are as follows: (1) To apply analytic approaches for conducting GWA mapping studies on  quantitative phenotypes related to offspring size at birth (birth weight, ponderal index, head circumference and adiposity) allowing  for other known influences such as gestational age, parity, and maternal weight gain.  (2) To apply the above approaches to identify  genetic variation that impacts maternal glucose tolerance at ~28 weeks of gestation (fasting glucose, glucose during an oral glucose  tolerance test, and insulin sensitivity expressed as quantitative traits) allowing for other known influences such as maternal weight  gain, parity and age. (3) To examine the interaction between maternal genes, the intrauterine environment, and fetal genes to identify  interactions that modulate genetic regulation of size at birth and fetal genetic variation that impacts on maternal glucose tolerance.  GWA mapping will provide initial evidence for association of specific SNPs with the quantitative traits outlined above.</p>  <p>As low and high birth weight are not only major causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality but have also been associated with  increased risk of metabolic diseases in adults, identification of genes that regulate fetal growth and maternal metabolism will  provide novel information about the pathways that regulate these processes as well as important insight into susceptibility genes  for chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes.</p>  <p>The Version 1 (v1) dbGaP release will include data only from the Hispanic study participants.  The Version 2 (v2) dbGaP   release will include data from the Hispanic and European ancestry study participants.

The NCIC Clinical Trials Group (CTG) serves as the   coordinating group, with participation by the NCI-sponsored North Central Cancer   Treatment Group, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Southwest Oncology Group, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).   MA.27 involved postmenopausal women with histologically confirmed and completely resected invasive breast cancer with surgical   margins clear of invasive carcinoma and DCIS in the following TMN categories (AJCC Version 6): pT1, pT2, pT3; pNx, pN0, pN1,   pN2, pN3 (only when the sole basis is presence of 10 or more involved axillary nodes); MO.  The primary tumor must have been   ER and/or progesterone receptor positive.  Patients were stratified by lymph node status at diagnosis, prior adjuvant chemotherapy,   and trastuzumab use and were randomized to 5 years of adjuvant therapy with anastrozole or exemestane. The trial was activated   on May 26, 2003, and reached its accrual objectives on July 31, 2008, after the randomization of 6827 North American patients,   with the majority (79%) providing DNA and consent for genetic testing.  Non-North American patients were also entered by the   International Breast Cancer Study Group but they did not contribute DNA.  From 2003 to December 21, 2004, patients also   underwent a second randomization to celecoxib 400 mg twice daily or placebo but, after the entry of 1,622 patients, this   treatment was discontinued because of reports of increased cardiovascular risk associated with celecoxib.   </p>      <p><u>Case Definition for Musculoskeletal Adverse Events</u><br/>   Cases were defined to have had at least one of the following six MSAE): 1. pain - joint, 2. pain - muscle, 3. pain - bone, 4.   arthritis, 5. joint - function, 6. musculoskeletal - other. Cases were required to have at least grade 3 toxicity, according   to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0, or go off treatment for any grade of the six MSAEs; and   were required to have had an MSAE within the first two years (i.e., a MSAE occurring after 2 years was not be considered   a case). Subjects were excluded from the case group who met the case definition while on celecoxib or in the three months   after stopping celecoxib but subjects were allowed to be cases if they developed their first MSAE more than three months   after stopping celecoxib.   </p>   <p><u>Study Design</u><br/>   The design was a nested matched case-control study with two controls selected for each case. Random matching from the potential control   group (i.e., risk-set sampling such that controls had at least the same length of followup as the timing of the case event) was   done by matching the case on the following factors: 1. treatment arm (exemestane vs. anastrozole, blinded), 2. prior   adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs. no), 3. age at start of treatment (+/- 5 years), 4. Celecoxib allocation (yes vs. no).  Attempts   were made to exactly match each case with two controls according to the above criteria. If, however, controls could not be   exactly matched, "close" matching was used to define a distance between each case and all potential controls in an optimal matching   algorithm.  Race is a potential confounding factor, and 94% of the MA.27 population is Caucasian, 3% are Black, 1% Asian, 1%   American Indian, and 1% are of unknown race. Because there are so few non-Caucasian participants, was restricted to only Caucasians.   Following identification of cases and controls, the list was sent to the CALGB Pathology Coordinating Office (PCO) at Ohio State   University Medical Center for plating of the samples.  Other patient factors that might influence the association of SNP   genotypes with a MSAE, either as confounding factors or as effect modifiers, were included as investigational covariates.   These include 1. body mass index (BMI), 2. bisphosphonate use, 3. fractures in past 10 years, 4. baseline ECOG performance status, 5.   prior hormone replacement therapy, 6. prior adjuvant radiotherapy, and 7. prior taxane treatment.  An Honest Broker Process was   utilized to ensure patient confidentiality.   </p>   <p><u>Genotype Assays and Quality Control</u><br/>   A GWAS was performed with the Illumina Human610-Quad at the RIKEN Center for Genomic Medicine.  The DNA for all of the samples were   adjusted to a concentration of 50 to 100 ng/&#181;L in a final volume of 50 &#181;L.  The 96-well plates were designed to have a unique   distribution pattern with x duplicates per plate to evaluate genotype concordance.  Samples with &lt;98% call rate were removed   from analyses.  SNPs with ambiguous call will be excluded using the following criteria: 1. low signal intensity of each   allele, 2. low cluster separation score, 3. SNP call rate &lt;0.98, 4. SNPs with Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium p-value &lt;0.001 were excluded.   X-chromosome SNPs were used to validate female sex and quality control measures were examined across the different submitting centers.   For all pairs of subjects, the percentage of matching genotypes were computed to screen for unexpected duplicate samples.  All SNPs   found to be associated with MSAE were subjected to visual inspection of the cluster plots to verify that the genotype clustering was   adequate.   </p>	Breast Neoplasms	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000210.v1.p1
phs000257.v2.p1	Human Gut Microbiome in Crohn's Disease	24	Twin	454 GS FLX Titanium	Microbiome Sequencing	\N	\N	\N	\N	<p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn&#39;s disease, are chronic, immunologically mediated disorders that have severe medical consequences. The current hypothesis is that these diseases are due to an overly aggressive immune response to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria. Studies to date on IBD have suggested that the disorder may be caused by a combination of bacteria and host susceptibility; however the etiologies of these diseases remain an enigma. In this application, we propose to develop and demonstrate the ability to profile Crohn&#39;s disease at an unprecedented molecular level by elucidation of specific biomarkers (bacterial strains, genes, or proteins) that correlate to disease symptoms. To achieve this goal, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach based on metagenomic and metaproteomic molecular tools to elucidate the composition of the commensal microbiota in monozygotic twins that are either healthy or exhibit Crohn&#39;s disease (for concordant, both are diseased; for discordant, one is healthy and one is diseased). The central hypotheses of this proposal are (1) that specific members and/or functional activities of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota differ in patients with Crohn&#39;s disease as compared to healthy individuals, and (2) that it will be possible to elucidate microbial signatures which correlate with the occurrence and progression of this disease by integration of data obtained from 16S rRNA-based molecular fingerprinting, metagenomics, and metaproteomics approaches. To address these hypotheses, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Obtain data on community gene content (metagenome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn&#39;s Disease to assess potential differences in the metabolic capabilities of the gut microbiota associated with CD, 2) Obtain data on community protein content (metaproteome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn&#39;s Disease to assess the state of expressed proteins associated with CD, 3) Apply various statistical clustering and classification methods to correlate/associate microbial community composition, gene and protein content with patient metadata, including metabolite profiles and clinical phenotype. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to identify novel biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostics of CD and to eventually identify drug targets (i.e. bacterial strains) for cure or suppression of disease symptoms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to unravel the contribution of the bacteria that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract to Crohn&#39;s disease by using a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities in three sets of patient cohorts who have Crohn&#39;s disease. These results will be compared with those obtained from the study of healthy individuals and have the potential to identify new biomarkers of disease severity, location, and progression.</p>	Crohn Disease;Colitis	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000257.v2.p1
phs000086.v2.p1	DCCT-EDIC Clinical Trial and Follow-up of Persons with Type 1 Diabetes	1497	Clinical Trial, Longitudinal	HumanHap550v3.0|ILLUMINA_Human_1M	GWAS	\N	Both	\N	\N	<p>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT, 1982-93) and the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complicationss   follow-up study (EDIC, 1994-2016) have been ongoing for more than twenty years.  After a mean follow-up of approximately 16 years,   the DCCT-EDIC cohort of 1,441 Type 1 diabetics had remained remarkably complete with more than 90% of the original cohort being   actively followed. Taken together, the DCCT clinical trial and subsequent EDIC longitudinal follow-up provide a uniquely rich source   of information on the impact of intensive therapy on glycemia and the its long-term complications for persons with Type 1 diabetes.  </p>     <p>The DCCT was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial (1, 2) designed to compare intensive with conventional diabetes therapy with regard  to their effects on the development and progression of the early complications of Type 1 diabetes.  The DCCT trial found that "intensive  therapy effectively delays the onset and slows the progression of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy" in patients with Type  1 diabetes (1).  The goal of the EDIC follow-up was to examine the longer term effects of the original DCCT interventions, especially as  they apply to late-occurring complications, such as cardiovascular disease and more advanced stages of retinal and renal disease (3).  The EDIC study has been remarkably fruitful in discovering the long term "imprinting" effects (metabolic memory) of the previous intensive  therapy, and in delineating the interactions among risk factors with regard to microvascular complications (4-6).  In addition, EDIC  established, for the first time, the role of intensive therapy and chronic glycemia on atherosclerosis (7-9).  </p>  <p><b>Note:</b> This study description has been prepared using materials authored by the DCCT-EDIC Data Coordinating Center.</p>  <p><a href="GetPdf.cgi?id=phd000390" target="_blank">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF STUDY</a></p>	Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Retinopathy;Diabetic Neuropathies;Diabetic Nephropathies	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000086.v2.p1

A large number of individuals with type 1 diabetes were screened to identify two subsets, one with clear-cut kidney disease and another with normal renal status despite long-term diabetes. Those who met additional entry criteria and consented to participate were enrolled. When possible, both parents were also enrolled to form family trios. Altogether, GoKinD includes 3043 participants comprising 931 cases, 944 singletons, 268 pairs of parents of cases, and 316 pairs of parents of control.  Accessible as a GAIN database are 905 of the cases, 890 of the controls, 10 pairs of parents of cases and 10 pairs of parents of controls (dbGaP <a href="./study.cgi?id=phs000018">phs000018</a> <i>Search for Susceptibility Genes for Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 1 Diabetes (GoKinD study participants), GAIN</i>).

The four communities are Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; the northwest  suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD.  ARIC is designed to investigate the etiology and natural history of atherosclerosis,  the etiology of clinical atherosclerotic diseases, and variation in cardiovascular risk factors, medical care and disease by race, gender,  location, and date.</p>  <p>ARIC includes two parts: the Cohort Component and the Community Surveillance Component.  The Cohort Component began in 1987, and each  ARIC field center randomly selected and recruited a cohort sample of approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 from a defined population  in their community.  A total of 15,792 participants received an extensive examination, including medical, social, and demographic data.  These participants were reexamined every three years with the first screen (baseline) occurring in 1987-89, the second in 1990-92, the  third in 1993-95, and the fourth and last exam was in 1996-98.  Follow-up occurs yearly by telephone to maintain contact with participants  and to assess health status of the cohort.</p>  <p>In the Community Surveillance Component, currently ongoing, these four communities are investigated to determine the community-wide   occurrence of hospitalized myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease deaths in men and women aged 35-84 years.  Hospitalized  stroke is investigated in cohort participants only.  Starting in 2006, the study conducts community surveillance of inpatient (ages   55 years and older) and outpatient heart failure (ages 65 years and older) for heart failure events beginning in 2005.</p>  <p>ARIC is currently funded through January 31, 2012.</p>  <p>This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative   (GENEVA, <a href="http://www.genevastudy.org" target="_blank">http://www.genevastudy.org</a>) funded by the trans-NIH Genes,   Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI).

Because diabetes is determined by both genetic and environmental factors, a better understanding of the   etiology of diabetes requires a careful investigation of gene-environment interactions. The Nurses&#39; Health Study (NHS) and   Health Professionals&#39; Follow-up Study (HPFS) are well-characterized cohort studies of women and men for whom stored blood   and DNA samples are available as well as detailed information on dietary and lifestyle variables. The major goals of the   project include: 1. To conduct a GWA analysis among 3,000 cases of T2D and 3,000 healthy controls in NHS/HPFS cohorts.   2. To use information on the joint effects of genes and a list of carefully selected environmental exposures at the   initial screening stage to test gene-environment interactions. This approach optimizes our power to detect variants   that have a sizeable marginal effect and those with a small marginal effect but a sizeable effect in a stratum defined   by an environmental exposure. For this analysis, we have developed a joint test of genetic marginal effect and   gene-environment interaction. This flexible two-degree-of-freedom test generally provides greater power than standard   methods and has the potential to uncover both marginal genetic effects and stratum-specific effects.</p>   <p>The Version 1 (v1) dbGaP release of data from the GENEVA Diabetes Study (NHS/HPFS) includes data from the NHS only.

To identify the genetic factors underlying this fatal  neurodegenerative disease, we performed a series of genome-wide association studies of ALS. These studies are divided into  three distinct stages, each associated with a separate data release. A description of each stage is provided below.</p>  <p>In the first stage, we genotyped 555,352 SNPs in 276 US cases diagnosed with ALS and 271 US controls. These samples were  obtained from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) DNA Repository at Coriell. The 276 US cases  were genotyped on Illumina HumanHap550v1.1 SNP arrays, whereas the 271 US controls were genotyped on both Illumina HumanHap250Sv1.0  and Illumina HumanHap300v1.1 SNP arrays. The genotype data was released in June 2008 under the accession number  <a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000101.v1.p1">phs000101.v1.p1</a> and was associated with the following publication:  Schymick JC et al.

This  portion of the project used a two-step approach: in step A, 545,066 SNPs were genotyped in 553 individuals with ALS  and 2,338 controls. Of note, this cohort included data from the 276 US cases and 271 US controls that had been previously  released in the first stage, <a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000101.v1.p1">phs000101.v1.p1</a>. The additional 277 ALS  cases that were newly genotyped in this stage were collected in a population-based manner from the North of Italy and were  genotyped on Illumina HumanHap550v1.1 SNP arrays. In step B, we brought forward the 7,600 most associated SNPs from step A,  and genotyped them in an additional cohort consisting of 2,160 cases and 3,008 controls using an Illumina iSelect custom  designed SNP array. The new data generated from this study was released in May 2010 (<a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000101.v2.p1">phs000101.v2.p1</a>)  and consisted of 1,456 case samples and 773 control samples for which participants provided consent to make their data  publicly available. We do not have permission to publicly release the genotype data from the rest of the samples. This data  release was associated with the following publication: Chi&#242; A et al.

Together with the 264 Italian  samples genotyped as part of stage 2, this brought the total number of samples that were whole genome genotyped samples to 504. These additional 236 patients  had been collected in a population-based manner from the Piedmonte region in the North of Italy, and were genotyped using  Illumina Human610Quad.v1 SNP arrays. The rational for this stage of the study arose from a <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</i>   publication by Landers et al. 2009, hypothesizing that genetic variation on chromosome 1q24 in the  vicinity of the KIFAP3 gene was associated with a significant improvement in survival of ALS patients. Our data failed to  replicate this finding suggesting that the original finding may have been a false positive finding. The data generated for  the extra 236 Italian ALS cases used in this study was released in April 2011 (<a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000101.v3.p1">phs000101.v3.p1</a>).

An estimated 500,000 children are born prematurely in the U.S. each year, and 5 million worldwide die annually of prematurity and its complications. Prematurity is also the single largest contributor to disability-adjusted life years, a measure of the lifetime impact of a disease. Despite the importance of the problem and its disproportionate occurrence in poor and minority populations, its underlying etiology (or etiologies) remains unknown; the single best predictor for preterm delivery is a previous preterm birth. The largest single cause of prematurity is spontaneous preterm labor, and suspected triggers for this include infection, stress, poor nutrition and genetic factors. Family and twin studies provide strong evidence that genetic factors underlie about 40% of the risk for prematurity. A major challenge in studying genetic factors in prematurity is maternal/uterine factors, fetal/placental factors, or both may influence risk. Thus, any approach to studying preterm birth should account for both infant and maternal risk, environmental covariates and interactions. The Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) is a well-established, prospective cohort that enrolled women early in pregnancy, prior to any adverse pregnancy outcomes, to minimize bias in data collection and sampling. See details at: <a href="http://www.ssi.dk/English" target="_blank">http://www.ssi.dk/English</a>.</p> <p>The DNBC followed over 100,000 pregnancies beginning in the first trimester and has extensive biological material and epidemiologic data on health outcomes in both mother and child. The current study posted on dbGaP contains data from a genome-wide case/control study using approximately 1,000 preterm mother-child pairs from the DNBC most with spontaneous onset of labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), along with 1,000 control pairs where the child was born at ~40 weeks&#39; gestation. After data cleaning some small changes in case/control status and other variables resulted in minor changes in numbers of cases or controls in certain categories. Environmental variables are being used as covariates in the analysis.</p> <p>To replicate positive findings, we are using additional mother-child pairs from the DNBC and from the general Danish population, as well as 2200 samples coming primarily from an African-American population known to have high rates of preterm labor and delivery. This group includes over 1000 mostly very low birthweight infants, over 500 infant term controls, 326 term mother/baby pairs and 180 preterm mother/baby pairs. The data from these additional cohorts will be available in separate dbGaP postings. The study is expected to yield a better understanding of the biology of parturition, identify common genetic factors that play a role in preterm birth and its complications and suggest environmental modifications that can prolong gestation, with the goal of improving both neonatal and adult outcomes.</p> <p>This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, <a href="http://www.genevastudy.org" target="_blank">http://www.genevastudy.org</a>) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI).

The ISCA Consortium is now working with the sequencing community to extend the goals of standardization, collaboration, and data sharing. To reflect this combined effort, we are becoming ICCG, or the International Collaboration for Clinical Genomics.</p> <p>Efforts of the Consortium include:</p> <p><b>Clinical Utility:</b> The ISCA Consortium has made recommendations regarding the appropriate clinical indications for cytogenetic array testing (Miller et al. AJHG 2010, PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20466091" target="_blank">20466091</a>). Currently, discussions are focused on pediatric applications for children with unexplained developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism and other developmental disabilities. A separate committee has been developed to address appropriate cancer genetic applications (<a href="http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/ccmc/" target="_blank">http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/ccmc/</a>).</p> <p><b>Evidence-based standards for cytogenomic array design:</b> The Consortium will develop recommendations for standards for the design, resolution and content of cytogenomic arrays using an evidence-based process and an international panel of experts in clinical genetics, clinical laboratory genetics (cytogenetics and molecular genetics), genomics and bioinformatics. This design is intended to be platform and vendor-neutral (common denominator is genome sequence coordinates), and is a dynamic process with input from the broader genetics community and evidence-based review by the expert panel (a Steering Committee with international representation).</p> <p><b>Public Database for clinical and research community:</b> It is essential that a publicly available database be created and maintained for cytogenetic array data generated in clinical testing laboratories. This will be integrated into the current dbGaP database at NCBI/NIH and released through dbVar, and curated by a committee of clinical genetics laboratory experts. The very high quality of copy number data (i.e., deletions and duplications) coming from clinical laboratories combined with expert curation will produce an invaluable resource to the clinical and research communities.</p> <p><b>Standards for interpretation of cytogenetic array results:</b> Using the ISCA Database, along with other genomic and genetics databases, the Consortium will develop recommendations for the interpretation and reporting of pathogenic vs. benign copy number changes as well as imbalances of uncertain clinical significance.</p> <p><b>Membership</b> in the ISCA Consortium is open to all individuals and laboratories involved in cytogenetic array testing who are committed to free data sharing and to participation in a process to develop evidence-based standards and guidelines to improve patient care.</p> <p><b>ISCA is available through dbVar:</b><br/> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd37" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd37/</a><br/> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd45" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd45/</a><br/> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd75/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd75/</a> </p>	Intellectual disability;Autistic Disorder;Congenital Abnormalities;Developmental Disabilities	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000205.v5.p2
phs000206.v3.p2	Pancreatic Cancer Cohort and Case-Control Consortium (PanScan)	7747	Cohort, Case-Control	Human610_Quadv1_B|HumanHap550v3.0	GWAS	Not specified	Both	\N	\N	<p>Within the framework of the NCI-sponsored Cohort Consortium, investigators from 12 prospective epidemiologic cohorts formed   the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium in 2006. This study, also known as "PanScan", is funded by the National Cancer   Institute (NCI) and involves conducting a genome-wide association study of common genetic variants to identify markers of   susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. In 2007, the study expanded to include 8 case-controls studies. The study team includes   scientists from the cohorts comprising the Consortium and NCI and from the PanC4 case-control studies.</p>   <p>The PanScan consortium has conducted two GWAS that have led to the discovery of four novel regions in the genome   associated with risk for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The first two scans were conducted in 12 cohort studies   and 8 case-control studies.</p>   <p>Initially, we genotyped 523,345 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 1,528 incident cases and 1,594 controls from   nested case-control studies of 12 cohorts plus 368 cases and 345 controls from one hospital-based case-control study.   Taqman replication of SNPs from the three most promising regions in the initial scan, as determined by rank p-values, was   done in 2,457 cases and 2,654 controls from eight case-control studies that were part of the PanC4 consortium. A combined   analysis identified an association between a locus on 9q34 and pancreatic cancer, the single nucleotide polymorphism   rs505922 (P= 5.37 x 10<sup>-8</sup>; multiplicative per-allele odds ratio (OR) 1.20; 95% CI 1.12-1.28), which maps to the first   intron of the ABO blood group gene whose protein determines an individual&#39;s blood group (Amundadottir et al, Nature Genetics 2009,   PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19648918" target="_blank">19648918</a>).</p>   <p>In PanScan 2, we conducted a combined analysis of 3,851 pancreatic cancer cases and 3,934 controls. These included 1896   cases and 1939 controls that were scanned in PanScan1 (above) and 1955 cases and 1995 controls that were newly scanned   in PanScan2.  The second GWAS did not include 502 cases and 659 controls that were part of the rapid replication.   (Please see the attached table for the total number of subjects who were GWASed and included in PanScan1 and PanScan2).   Three new regions were identified: chromosome 13q22.1 (rs9543325; P=3.27 x 10<sup>-11</sup>; per-allele odds   ratio (OR) 1.26; 95% CI 1.18-1.35); chromosome 1q32.1 in the NR5A2 gene (rs3790844; P=2.45 x 10<sup>-10</sup>; per-allele   OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.71-0.84); and chromosome 5p15.33 (rs401681 in the CLPTM1L and TERT region; P=3.66 x 10<sup>-7</sup>; per-allele   OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.11-1.27). The first two regions have not been identified in GWAS of cancer to date but the last   region has been reported to be associated with risk of other malignancies (Petersen et al, Nature Genetics 2010,   PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20101243" target="_blank">20101243</a>).</p>	Pancreatic Neoplasms	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000206.v3.p2
phs000258.v2.p1	Human Gut Microbiome in Amish Obesity	404	Longitudinal	454 GS FLX Titanium	Microbiome Sequencing	Amish	\N	\N	\N	<p>Emerging evidence that the gut microbiota may contribute in important ways to human health and disease has led  us and others to hypothesize that both symbiotic and pathological relationships between gut microbes and their host  may be key contributors to obesity and the metabolic complications of obesity. Our "Thrifty Microbiome Hypothesis"  poses that gut microbiota play a key role in human energy homeostasis. Specifically, constituents of the gut microbial  community may introduce a survival advantage to its host in times of nutrient scarcity, promoting positive energy  balance by increasing efficiency of nutrient absorption and improving metabolic efficiency and energy storage.  However, in the presence of excess nutrients, fat accretion and obesity may result, and in genetically predisposed  individuals, increased fat mass may result in preferential abdominal obesity, ectopic fat deposition (liver, muscle),  and metabolic complications of obesity (insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). Furthermore, in the  presence of excess nutrients, a pathological transition of the gut microbial community may occur, causing leakage  of bacterial products into the intestinal lymphatics and portal circulation, thereby inducing an inflammatory state,  further aggravating metabolic syndrome traits and accelerating atherosclerosis. This pathological transition and  the extent to which antimicrobial leakage occurs and causes inflammatory and other maladaptive sequelae of obesity  may also be influenced by host factors, including genetics. In the proposed study, we will directly test the Thrifty  Microbiome Hypothesis by performing detailed genomic and functional assessment of gut microbial communities in intensively  phenotyped and genotyped human subjects before and after intentional manipulation of the gut microbiome. To address  these hypotheses, five specific aims are proposed: (1) enroll three age- and sex-matched groups from the Old Order  Amish: (i) 50 obese subjects (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) with metabolic syndrome, (ii) 50 obese subjects (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2)  without metabolic syndrome, and (iii) 50 non-obese subjects (BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2) without metabolic syndrome and  characterize the architecture of the gut microbiota from the subjects enrolled in this study by high-throughput  sequencing of 16S rRNA genes; (2) characterize the gene content (metagenome) to assess the metabolic potential of  the gut microbiota in 75 subjects to determine whether particular genes or pathways are correlated with disease  phenotype; (3) characterize the transcriptome in 75 subjects to determine whether differences in gene expression  in the gut microbiota are correlated with disease phenotype, (4) determine the effect of manipulation of the gut  microbiota with antibiotics on energy homeostasis, inflammation markers, and metabolic syndrome traits in 50 obese  subjects with metabolic syndrome and (5) study the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolic and cardiovascular  disease traits, weight change, and host genomics in 1,000 Amish already characterized for these traits and in whom  500K Affymetrix SNP chips have already been completed. These studies will provide our deepest understanding to date  of the role of gut microbes in terms of &#39;who&#39;s there?&#39;, &#39;what are they doing?&#39;, and &#39;how are they influencing host  energy homeostasis, obesity and its metabolic complications? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to unravel the  contribution of the bacteria that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract to the development of obesity,  and its more severe metabolic consequences including cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and Type II diabetes.  We will take a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities  in three sets of Old Order Amish patients from Lancaster, Pennsylvania: obese patients, obese patients with metabolic  syndrome and non-obese individuals. The Old Order Amish are a genetically closed homogeneous Caucasian population of  Central European ancestry ideal for genetic studies. These works have the potential to provide new mechanistic insights  into the role of gut microflora in obesity and metabolic syndrome, a disease that is responsible for significant morbidity  in the adult population, and may ultimately lead to novel approaches for prevention and treatment of this disorder.</p>	Obesity;Obesity, Morbid	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000258.v2.p1

These two studies, PROGENI (PI: Tatiana Foroud; R01NS037167) and GenePD (PI: Richard Myers; R01NS036711)  have been evaluating and recruiting families with two or more PD affected members for more than 8 years and represent the  largest such cohorts world-wide. The combined sample has more than 1,000 PD families.

phs000127.v2.p1	Study of Irish Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (SIALS)	432	Case-Control	Genome Analyzer II|HumanHap550v3.0	GWAS	European American	\N	\N	\N	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons.      Epidemiological studies indicate that 2-5% of cases are familial, usually with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.      For a portion of these, causative genes have been identified.  The remaining 95% of ALS cases are described as sporadic,      and believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p>      <p>This study utilized samples from Irish patients with sporadic ALS and Irish control individuals.  The aim of the study   was to identify susceptibility alleles for ALS in the Irish population.  Genome-wide, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)   genotyping was undertaken using Illumina 550K version 3 chips.  Genotyping data are available on 221 SALS patients   and 211 controls.</p>   <p>Future work will aim to examine ALS genetic risk at individual sequence level.  As an initial step, as of September 2010   we have made available the human genome sequence from a single anonymous male control individual from the SIALS collection.</p>   <p>Recent studies generating complete human sequences from Asian, African and European subgroupings have revealed population   specific variation and illuminated disease susceptibility loci.  The Irish population is of interest because of its   location at the periphery of Europe and also the impact its emigrants have had on the genetics of populations in a   number of other countries.  We have identified sequence variants that may be specific to this population and have   identified potentially novel disease associated variants.  We describe a novel method for improving SNP calling   accuracy at low genome coverage using haplotype information.  Overall we demonstrate utility in generating whole genome   sequences to test general principles and reveal specific instances of human biology.  With increasing access to low cost   sequencing we would predict that similar studies will emerge.</p>	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Motor Neuron Disease	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000127.v2.p1

The Framingham Heart Study &#8212; under the direction of National Heart,      Lung, and Blood Institute; NHLBI &#8212; began in 1948 with the recruitment of adults from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. At the      time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for cardiovascular disease (CVD)      had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the 20th century and had become an American epidemic. The Framingham Heart Study      is now conducted in collaboration with Boston University.      </p>      <p>The objective of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following      its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered      a heart attack or stroke.      </p>      <p>Between 1948 and 1953 the researchers recruited 5,209 subjects (2,336 men and 2,873 women) between the ages of 29 and 62 from the town      of Framingham, Massachusetts and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later      analyze for common patterns related to CVD development.  Subjects were recruited from lists of addresses recorded for the town.  Two out      of every three households were approached for participation in the study.  While there was no intention to recruit families for family      studies, the plan was to recruit all household members in the ages 30-60 within each house that was selected for study.  Hence, many      biologically related individuals were recruited, including 1644 spouse pairs.  Since 1948, these participants have returned to the study      every two years for a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.  Now in 2008 at 60 years of follow up, there      remain about 500 participants from this cohort.   </p>      <p>Between 1971 and 1975 the study enrolled a second-generation group &#8212; 5,124 of the original participants&#39; children and the spouses of      these children &#8212; to participate in similar examinations.   2,616 subjects are offspring of the original spouse pairs and 34 are      stepchildren. A total of 898 offspring are children of cohort members where only one parent was a study participant and 1,576 are spouses      of the offspring. The Offspring Cohort has been followed every four years through 2001 (except between Exams 1 and 2 with an intervening      8 years) using protocols similar to those used for study of the Original Cohort.      </p>      <p>Between 2002 and 2005 the study enrolled the third generation (Gen3) of the Framingham Heart Study - 4095 offspring of the second generation.      None of their spouses were recruited.  An additional 103 parents of this third generation, who were not recruited between 1971 and 1975,      were also recruited at this time.  The latter group is not included in the GAW16 data.  With the recruitment of this third generation, the      study has increasingly focused on genetic factors associated with the development of cardiovascular disease and its associated risk factors.      To date, there is only one examination of this generation of participants.  A description of the recruitment of this third generation and      comparison with the earlier generations at their initial recruitment is presented in      <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17372189" target="_blank">Splansky GL et al., 2007</a>.      </p>      <p>Further information on the Study can be found at <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/index.html</a>.</p>     <p><b>Genome-wide Dense SNP Scan in Framingham Heart Study</b></p>   <p>Genetic studies did not begin in the FHS until the 1990s.  In the late 1980s and through the 1990s DNA was extracted from blood samples of      surviving FHS participants.   In 2007, the FHS entered a new phase with the conduct of genotyping for the FHS SHARe (SNP Health Association      Resource) project, for which dense SNP genotyping was performed using approximately 550,000 SNPs (GeneChip&#174; Human Mapping 500K Array Set and      the 50K Human Gene Focused Panel) in 10,775 samples (some duplicates) from the three generations of subjects (including over 900 pedigrees).      Affymetrix conducted all genotyping for the FHS SHARe project, using the 250K Sty, 250K Nsp, and the supplemental 50K platforms.  Eighty-nine      percent of the DNA samples were collected during the 1990s.  To maximize the power of the study, we also extracted DNA from 1133 blood samples,      drawn from subjects who had no DNA, to include in the SHARe project.  These samples had been sitting in our refrigerators for some time, a      few as far back as the 1970s.  We refer to these DNA samples as the legacy samples. These samples had a higher failure rate in the genotyping      process (40%) than the other eighty-nine percent (3%). Affymetrix invoked its own criteria for a sample to succeed in genotyping.  All      non-legacy samples must succeed on all three platforms, while legacy samples needed to pass on at least one platform.  When a sample failed,      additional attempts were made.  Samples that repeatedly failed 2-4 times were called failures.  Other samples failed due to issues of genotyped      sex identification not matching our records or low SNP concordance among SNPs common across arrays or contamination.  Eighty-nine percent of      the legacy samples for which genotyping results are available passed all three platforms.  The genotyping data from the 10,043 samples from      9354 subjects that passed the Affymetrix criteria were additionally checked for gender consistency and consistency with family structure,      resulting in genotyping data for 9,274 participants in FHS SHARe.  Genotype calls were made with the BRLMM algorithm.   </p>   <p>The SHARe database is housed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information      <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007">database of genotypes and phenotypes (NCBI dbGaP)</a>      and contains all ~550,000 SNPs.  This genome-wide dense SNP scan and a subset of phenotypes from the Framingham Heart Study are the focus of      the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16.   </p>   <p>Further information on the specific variables in the Problem 2 dataset can be found by clicking on the Documents tab at the top of the page.   </p>     <p><b>Problem 3: Description of the Simulated Data Set</b></p>   <p>The focus of this simulation is gene discovery in genome-wide association scans (GWAS). The Framingham Heart Study data      set (distributed as "Problem 2") is the basis for the FHS* simulated data.  The pedigree structures are derived from the    data distributed for Problem 2, and we distribute an accompanying triplet file (triplet_sim) containing person ID, father ID,    mother ID, to ensure the identical subjects, pedigrees, and singletons are used in the simulated data analysis. Consistent with    standard practice, founders and singletons are designated as subjects with both fshare and mshare equal to zero (missing). The    simulated data includes a total of 6,479 subjects with both phenotype and genotype data, in 942 pedigrees distributed among 3    generations and 188 singletons. Data inclusion is consistent with the subjects&#39; consent for use by both for-profit and not-for-profit    researchers. The genotypes for all Problem 3 replicates are fixed as measured and distributed for Problem 2 for both the genomewide    scan and the additional candidate gene SNPs, for a total of approximately 550,000 SNPs (GeneChip&#174; Human Mapping 500K Array Set and the    50K Human Gene Focused Panel).  Thus, to analyze the Problem 3 simulated data you also will need to download the Problem 2 genotypes.    Note that there are slight discrepancies in counts between Problems 2 and 3 due to a change in consents between the two datasets.   </p>   <p>Several phenotypes that contribute to coronary heart disease (CHD) were simulated for all individuals with genotypes across     three different time points, 10 years apart. All genotyped individuals have complete data; the effects of missing values can be   investigated by user-specified missing value patterns. There are 200 longitudinal datasets created, based on the generating model, and    each replication is found in a separate dataset. We suggest that if only one replication is to be analyzed, that it be   replication 1 to enable more precise comparisons among analytical approaches. The &#39;shareid&#39; will allow you to merge the    simulated phenotype data with the Problem 2 genotype data, and reconstruction of the pedigrees using the distributed &#39;triplet_sim&#39;   file or for larger families&#39; relationships with the triplet distributed with the Problem 2.   </p>   <p>The simulated data problem is further described in the associated readme file, and a data dictionary is provided defining     all the variables.

Cases were selected to have Crohn&#39;s disease     with ileal involvement, and controls were matched to cases based on sex and year of birth. Subjects were drawn from     two cohorts: (1) persons with non-Jewish, European ancestry (561 cases and 563 controls), and (2) persons with     Jewish ancestry (407 cases and 432 controls). Genotyping was performed at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research.</p>     <p>Seven-hundred fifty-four of the samples (468 cases and 286 controls) were taken from the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium     cell line repository. These samples are identified in the IBD_Sample file. The subject IDs for these individuals may be     used to request corresponding samples for follow-up research through the repository. In addition, complete phenotype data for     these individuals are available, together with the Consortium&#39;s phenotyping manual and the forms used to collect the data. The     remaining 1,209 samples were obtained from pre-existing collections ascertained through Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Johns Hopkins     University, University of Chicago, University of Montreal, University of Pittsburgh, University of Toronto, and the New York Health     project (controls only). For these samples, only sex, cohort (Jewish vs. non-Jewish), and age at diagnosis (cases only) are     available.</p>     <p>Two-hundred three individuals from among the pre-existing samples did not provide consent to release their genotype     data (designated as consent group 2 in the file IBD_Subject). Thus, individual genotype data are only provided for 1,760     samples. To compensate for this, we have provided summary results for each SNP. These are based on a stratified analysis testing     case/control association.

Although skeletal architecture contributes to fracture risk, bone mineral density (BMD) is the most important determinant of bonestrength and fracture risk.  Between 60 and 80% of the variance of BMD of adult Caucasian women is due to heritable factors.Final BMD is a function of peak bone mass attained during young adulthood and the subsequent rate of bone loss, which occurs as a result of both post-menopausal estrogen loss and aging.  The evidence for a genetic contribution to rate of loss in BMD is substantially weaker than that for peak BMD. Therefore, we have focused our sample collection on the recruitment of premenopausal women, in whom we havesought to identify the genes influencing peak BMD at the spine and hip, the two major skeletal sites of osteoporotic fracture.</p><p>The primary goal of this study is to identify genes that affect peak BMD in premenopausal women. Identification of these genes may: 1) lead to molecular tests that predict risk of osteoporosis and allow institution of early preventive measures; 2) provide insight into basic bone cell biology and other factors that affect peak BMD; and 3) provide molecular targets for therapeutic agents to increase BMD.</p>	Osteoporosis;Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal;Bone Density	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000138.v2.p1

Family studies suggest a genetically complex contribution   to BD.  With the exception of HLA-B51, which explains less than 20% of the genetic risk, the identities of alleles that are   responsible for the complex inheritance of this disease have remained unclear.</p>   <p><b>Aim</b><br/>To identify genes that contribute to BD susceptibility.</p>   <p><b>Methods</b><br/>A genome-wide association study was undertaken with 311,459 informative and high quality SNPs in a   collection of 1215 BD patients and 1278 healthy controls from Turkey using a beadchip microarray assay (Infinium SNP   genotype assay, Illumina).  HLA-B types were determined with a reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotide method (One Lambda).   Regions with evidence for association were fine-mapped using Sequenom iPLEX gold assays.  Disease-associated SNPs were   genotyped in additional ethnically matched case/control collections from diverse genetic backgrounds, including a total   of 2430 cases and 2660 controls, using TaqMan SNP genotype assays.  Association data were combined in a meta-analysis   of all the collections.</p>   <p><b>Results</b><br/>We confirmed the known association with HLA-B51 and found evidence for a second, independent   susceptibility locus in the Class I region of the MHC. In addition, we identified one SNP with genome-wide evidence for   disease association (P &lt; 5.0 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) within the gene encoding the immunoregulatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL10). A   meta-analysis of the data from all the collections established associations with the IL10 variant (rs1518111,   P = 3.54 x 10<sup>-18</sup>, odds ratio 1.45 with 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 1.58) and with a variant located between the   interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) and interleukin 12 receptor &#946;2 (IL12RB2) genes (rs924080, P = 6.69 x 10<sup>-9</sup>, odds   ratio 1.28 with 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.39). The disease-associated IL10 variant was associated with diminished   mRNA expression and low protein production by cells obtained from healthy blood donors.</p>   <p><b>Conclusions</b><br/>These data suggest that genetically encoded low production of IL-10 increases risk of BD and   suggest novel interventional targets in the IL-10 and IL-23 pathways.</p>   <p>Note: The submitted data are the genotypes of the 311,459 SNPs in 1215 cases and 1278 controls.</p>	Behcet Syndrome	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000272.v1.p1

During this study we performed a high density 1 million-SNP genome scan on subjects from GeneSTAR (representing 800 2-generational families with a family history of premature coronary artery disease, 60% white and 40% African American, N=3232). We identified genomic loci associated with quantitative platelet phenotypes prioritized for their biological interest, determined associations between genomic loci and baseline platelet phenotypes (primary phenotypes are platelet aggregation in platelet rich plasma induced by collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid (AA), and epinephrine (Epi), determined associations between genomic loci and post-ASA platelet phenotypes, ie, measures of ASA "resistance" (primary phenotypes are as above, plus urinary levels of the prostaglandin metabolite, 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 ), and compared peaks of association between genomic loci and three common baseline platelet phenotypes (collagen-, epinephrine-, and ADP-induced aggregation in platelet rich plasma) with associations found for these same phenotypes in the Framingham Heart Study. We also determined whether any significant genotype-phenotype associations in the 1 million SNP genome scan could be localized to any specific genes or potential genes of interest using publicly available databases and further examined whether candidate genes previously associated with a specific platelet phenotype are located in a genomic region of interest as determined from the SNP genome scan. We conducted replications of our findings, and are presently involved in larger scale meta-analysis of findings for pre-aspirin and post-aspirin associations.</p> <p>The study population is constituted of full siblings (SIBS) (ages 35-78 years) identified from The Johns Hopkins Sibling Study, now called GeneSTAR, the spouses of the SIBS, and their adult offspring (&gt;21 years of age). They include 3200 individuals from approximately 300 African American and 500 white extended families. "Spouse" refers to the other parent of any SIB offspring, independent of marital status. Sibship sizes among families range from 1 to 16 (excluding index cases). On average, each SIB has 2 potentially eligible offspring. A family for this study is defined by all of the full sibships and the total numbers of offspring that come from all SIBS, rather than just the nuclear family.</p>	Platelet Aggregation;Blood Physiological Phenomena;Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000375.v1.p1

The recent definitive linkage genome screen demonstrated that there is no other MS risk gene with an effect size anywhere near that of the MHC.  However, linkage analysis is significantly hampered by reduced power in the face of heterogeneity and requires multiplex families, which also hampers acquiring an appropriate sample size.  In contrast, genotyping 500K SNPs allows us to survey a significant amount of the genome (we estimate >70%) directly for allelic or genotypic association.  This uses the improved power of association analysis and can also take advantage of the linkage disequilibrium relationships among SNPs to further increase power (e.g. haplotype analysis).  Quality control and data analysis are significant challenges.  We will initially perform substantial QC checks and analyze the data using both TDT and AFBAC approaches.  Multigenic interactions will also be tested using MDR.</p>	Multiple Sclerosis;Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive;Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000139.v1.p1

This represents approximately 13% of the African American   population and a significant proportion of the 21 million Americans living with diabetes. On average, an African American individual   is twice as likely to have T2DM as a European American peer. Our research group has been actively involved in the study of African   American diabetes genetics for over 15 years. We hypothesize that genes contributing to the development of T2DM in African Americans   exist and can be located using modern molecular genetic methods. With the exception of TCF7L2(Transcription factor 7-like 2) evidence   to date suggests variants that contribute T2DM risk in European-derived populations are not significant contributors to African   American T2DM risk. We have performed a SNP-based Whole Genome Association (WGA) analysis on the Affymetrix 6.0 in a   case control population of over 1000 African American T2DM cases and over 1000 non-diabetic controls. The DNAs have been   collected from participants using uniform criteria from North Carolina and neighboring states.

There  is substantial evidence that genetic factors play a significant role in the development of non-syndromic myopia and glaucoma.  We propose to  perform mapping studies for well-characterized twin populations in the United Kingdom and Australia in order to ultimately identify implicated  genes for these disorders and related ocular parameters.

Instead of limited analyses of the trait/disease in  a dichotomous manner, we are using continuous phenotypes of measures of refraction and intermediate phenotypes of glaucoma to analyze quantitative  traits in unselected population samples of volunteer twins.

The field office opened in February 1981 and has operated continuously since  then. During this time, three systematic surveys of the population have been conducted as well as family and longitudinal studies.  Culturally sensitive diabetes education programs have been developed and implemented and also a weight loss intervention. In total,  more than 23,000 Mexican American individuals have been examined with more than 200,000 aliquots of biological specimens stored.  Collectively, these studies are known as the Starr County Health Studies.</p>  <p>The present Genetics of Diabetes Study has the goal of identifying loci/alleles that underlie susceptibility to type 2 diabetes  in this high risk population using genome wide markers and association testing. The study makes use of two primary resources that  have been developed in order to identify 1,000 type 2 diabetes cases and 1,000 disease free controls. In the first instance we have  identified a subset of unrelated cases from the total cases that we have identified. Where multiply affected sibships were available,  the youngest onset case with detailed phenotyping (including assessment of diabetic retinopathy) was selected. Controls came from a  recent survey to establish a representative sample of the Starr County population. Blocks were randomly selected, households on  selected blocks enumerated and one individual randomly selected from each household for a detailed examination. The examination  included an oral glucose tolerance test. Those included as controls are those with no prior diagnosis of diabetes and a negative oral  glucose tolerance test.</p>  <p>This collection of cases and controls provides the opportunity to identify susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes and its  complications, specifically diabetic retinopathy and albuminuria. The data set also allows the examination of impaired fasting  glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. The samples are split between those born in the United States and those born in Mexico and  this gives a natural contrast for examining genotype and environmental interactions. It is anticipated that the understanding that  will come will lead to strategies for delaying and preventing the onset of diabetes and its complications.</p>	Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Diabetic Retinopathy	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000143.v1.p1

These advances have the potential to dramatically impact drug discovery and development by identifying genetic factors that contribute to variation in disease risk as well as drug pharmacokinetics, treatment efficacy, and adverse drug reactions. In spite of the technological advancements, successful application in biomedical research would be limited without access to suitable sample collections. To facilitate exploratory genetic research, we have assembled a DNA resource from a large number of subjects participating in multiple studies throughout the world. This resource was initially genotyped using the Affymetrix 500K SNP panel. This project includes nearly 6,000 subjects of African American, East Asian, South Asian, Mexican, and European origin.</p> <p>POPRES version 3</p> <p>The discovery and development of novel drugs is challenging and with high attrition rates. Selection of the right target and optimal indications for novel therapeutics represent key decision points in this process, and are often hampered by our limited understanding of the biology of the target in humans. Building a robust body of knowledge of variation within drug target genes has in several cases increased the probability of success for novel therapeutics. Our knowledge of variation within drug target genes and their influence on traits of medical interest is still very limited. In an effort to fill this gap, we resequenced the exons of 202 known or suspected drug target genes in over 16,000 well-phenotyped individuals. A total of 863,883 bases were targeted, including 351 kb of coding and 323 kb of untranslated exon regions.

We genotyped about half of the EA sample and almost all of the AA sample under the auspices of the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) with the Affymetrix 6.0 platform at the Broad Institute.  The remainder of the included sample was also genotyped with the Affymetrix 6.0 platform at the Broad Institute, and we refer to this component as the nonGAIN sample.  Cases met criteria for schizophrenia (SCZ) or schizoaffective disorder (SA) per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version IV (DSM-IV) for all three collections (SGI, MGS1, and MGS2) comprising these cases.  However, for the older SGI collection, codes for the secondary diagnoses refer to the older DSM-III-R version.

Genetic   factors contribute to the risk for disease with heritability estimates ranging from 57% to 79%. More than a decade ago, the &#949;4   variant of APOE was identified and remains the most consistently replicated genetic variant influencing the risk of late onset   Alzheimer disease. A segregation analysis suggests there may be four additional genes influencing the age-at-onset of Alzheimer   disease. In 2007 there were 968 association studies in 398 candidate genes reported, but none replicated consistently. There are   many reasons for the lack of consistency, but one important reason for the lack of progress is the paucity of a sufficient number   of well characterized families and patients available to the entire scientific community. The extensive effort and expense required   to ascertain such a population has been addressed by the NIA-LOAD Family Study. Its goal is to identify and recruit families with two   or more siblings with the late-onset form of Alzheimer&#39;s disease and a cohort of unrelated, non-demented controls similar in age   and ethnic background, and to make the samples, the clinical and genotyping data and preliminary analyses available to qualified   investigators world-wide. Genotyping by the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) was performed using the Illumina Infinium II   assay protocol with hybridization to Illumina Human 610Quadv1_B Beadchips.  This genotyping represents the largest collection of   families ever assembled with Alzheimer&#39;s disease combining the NIA-LOAD Genetics Initiative Multiplex Family Study, the National   Cell Repository for Alzheimer&#39;s Disease (NCRAD) with additional controls from the University of Kentucky. These genotyping results   will serve as a focal point for future research that will identify all of the remaining genetic variants in Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p>	Alzheimer Disease;Dementia	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000168.v1.p1

This project will establish a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,000 subjects will be recruited, including control smokers, definite COPD cases (GOLD Stage 2 to 4), and subjects not included in either group (GOLD 1 or GOLD-Unclassified). This cohort will be used for cross-sectional analysis, although long-term longitudinal follow-up will be a future goal. The primary focus of the study will be genome-wide association analysis to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of both cases and controls, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. <b>The hypotheses to be studied are: 1) Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, will provide data that will enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into clinically significant subtypes. 2) Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes. 3) Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease.</b> The initial phase of genome-wide association analysis included 500 COPD cases and 500 control subjects (all non-Hispanic White) genotyped with the Illumina Omni-1 chip, but plans are being developed to obtain genome-wide association analysis on the entire study cohort (using the Illumina Omni-Express chip).

Three coordinated studies, using a shared assessment protocol and with a shared goal of gene-discovery, were conducted - one funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the others by the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse - by investigators associated with the Midwest Alcoholism Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis, and investigators at Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia (led by Professor Nicholas Martin), using informative families identified from these cohorts. The first of these (NIDA Nicotine Addiction Genetics [NAG] project, PI Pamela Madden) identified index cases from the 3 cohorts with a history of heavy smoking (smoked 20 or more cigarettes daily, or 40 or more cigarettes on 1 or more occasions) and with additional available full siblings who were smokers, and interviewed and obtained blood samples from twins, and cooperative full siblings and parents, in order to identify families that would be informative for linkage analysis of a quantitative heaviness of smoking trait. The second identified additional families with an index case who either reported a history of alcohol dependence (DSM-IV), or scored above the 85th percentile on a quantitative measure of heaviness of alcohol use (alcohol factor score), derived from measures of frequency of heavy drinking, frequency of drinking to intoxication, and typical weekly consumption in standard drinks (all referenced to the respondent&#39;s heaviest drinking period) and of lifetime maximum 1-day alcohol consumption and maximum tolerance to alcohol (drinks before getting drunk or before feeling effects of alcohol). Interview and DNA were obtained from index cases and siblings, and DNA only from available parents. The goal of this second study (NIAAA OZ-ALCOHOL EDAC study, PI Andrew Heath) was to identify sibships including pairs who were either extreme concordant for the quantitative consumption measure (both scoring above the 85th percentile) or extreme discordant (one scoring above the 85th percentile and one scoring below the 30th percentile) that would be informative for linkage analysis. The third identified additional sibships solely on the basis of large sibship size, regardless of alcohol or tobacco use phenotypes (NIAAA OZ-BIGSIB study, PIs the late Richard Todd, Andrew Heath). From these coordinated studies a case-control series of alcohol dependent individuals and unaffected controls were constructed for a family-based Genomewide Association Study (OZALC-GWAS) of heaviness of alcohol use and alcohol dependence, funded by the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse.

AMD is a  late-onset multi-factorial neurodegenerative disease and its pathogenesis involves interaction of  genetic and environmental factors.  Several chromosomal regions have been associated with AMD susceptibility through linkage  analysis (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19405847">Swaroop et al., 2009</a>).  More recent studies provide  strong evidence that variants within the CFH gene cluster on chromosome 1 and at/near LOC387715/ARMS2 on chromosome 10 are  strongly associated with disease.  Variants at other genes including C2/BF, C3, CFI and APOE4, also contribute to AMD susceptibility.</p>  <p>Our primary goals are to identify genetic variants and haplotypes that are associated with AMD.  The underlying hypothesis  is that DNA variation(s) in multiple genetic susceptibility loci will predispose individuals to AMD pathogenesis, and comparison  of DNA of cases and controls should identify these susceptibility variants.  Our studies are focused on the genetic  analysis of advanced AMD and should provide novel insights into disease diagnosis, progression and pathology.</p>  <p>We have assembled a collaborative group of researchers from the University of Michigan, Mayo Clinic,  University of Pennsylvania, and the AREDS group including National Eye Institute intramural investigators, who collected clinical data  and DNA from a large number of patients affected with AMD and from unaffected controls.  The primary source of funding was National Eye  Institute.

The Hutterites in our studies live on communal farms in South Dakota and are   related to each other through multiple lines of descent in a 3,657-person, 13-generation pedigree with 64 founders.   The small number of founding genomes reduces genetic heterogeneity whereas their communal lifestyle ensures that   non-genetic factors are remarkably uniform between individuals. During our <u>Phase 1 studies</u>, between 1996 and 1997,   we measured qualitative and quantitative phenotypes that are associated with common diseases in ~750 individuals   living in 9 Hutterite colonies.  These individuals were genotyped using the Affymetrix 500k array. The SNPs included   in our GWAS had &gt;90% call rates, minor allele frequencies &gt;5%, Hardy-Weinberg p-values &gt;0.001 (corrected   for Hutterite population structure), and fewer than 5 Mendelian errors.  During our Phase 2 studies,   between 2006 and 2009, we phenotyped ~900 individuals living in 9 Hutterite colonies (7 overlapping with   Phase 1 colonies).

This program has conducted     over 21,000 physical examinations, assembled a shared database of several hundred BP and hypertension-related phenotypic measurements,     completed genome-wide linkage analyses for BP, hypertension, and hypertension associated risk factors and complications, and published     over 130 manuscripts on program findings.  The FBPP emerged from what was initially funded as four independent networks of investigators     (HyperGEN, GenNet, SAPPHIRe and GENOA) competing to identify genetic determinants of hypertension in multiple ethnic groups.  Realizing     the greater likelihood of success through collaboration, the investigators began working together during the first funding     cycle (1995-2000) and formalized this arrangement in the second cycle (2000-2005), creating a single confederation with program-wide     and network-specific goals.</p>	Peripheral Arterial Disease;Coronary Atherosclerosis;Leukoaraiosis;Kidney Diseases	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000379.v1.p1

M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The goal of this research is to identify novel susceptibility and outcome-related genes for melanoma using a systematic genome-wide association-based approach. Our goal is to conduct high-density SNP association and outcome studies. This dbGaP study contains samples from 2000 European ancestry cases and 1000 European ancestry controls using the Illumina OMNI1-Quad SNP chip. As a part of an ongoing R01 project, we have epidemiological data together with candidate gene results for 1000 of the melanoma cases and the controls. With regard to the outcome aspect of our design, as part of our melanoma Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) grant, our MelCore database contains comprehensive, prospectively maintained clinical information from all melanoma patients included in the study cohort, including primary tumor histopathology and staging information, standard and investigational blood tumor markers, details of surgical and systemic therapies, and extensive follow-up information, including time to relapse or recurrence, pattern of recurrence and survival duration. Finally, we intend to collaborate with the GenoMEL collaboration so we can jointly evaluate each other&#39;s findings. The goal of our analysis will be to identify novel genetic factors predisposing the development of melanoma, as well as genetic factors controlling melanoma stage at presentation, recurrence and progression.</p> <p>This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, <a href="http://www.genevastudy.org" target="_blank">http://www.genevastudy.org</a>) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to melanoma through large-scale genome-wide association studies of 2000 European ancestry cases and 1000 European ancestry controls. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR).

PD is a common, progressive, age-related, movement disorder that  affects 1-2% of the people over the age of 65.  The NeuroGenetics Research Consortium (NGRC) is the infrastructure of the study.  Protocols and methods are standardized across NGRC clinics and labs as much as possible.  The 2000 patients and 2000 control  subjects selected for this GWAS were recruited at the NGRC-affiliated movement disorder clinics in Oregon, Washington, Georgia  and New York.  All 4000 subjects were white and all DNA samples were extracted from whole blood and unamplified.  Seventy-five  percent of subjects have data on cigarette smoking and caffeinated coffee consumption, which are inversely associated with PD  risk.  This study population represents the norm for clinical genetic studies of PD; i.e., NGRC estimates of risk to relatives,  heritability, genotype frequencies, and exposure frequencies (see references) are very close to estimates from meta-analyses.</p>	Parkinson Disease	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000196.v2.p1

This large cohort analyzed for CNVs in a single study using a uniform array platform and   computational tools, comprises mainly of Caucasians (65.2%) and African-Americans (34.2%), We have catalogued and   characterized 54,462 individual CNVs, 77.8% of which were identified in multiple unrelated individuals. These non-unique CNVs   mapped to 3,272 distinct regions of genomic variation spanning 5.9% of the genome; 51.5% of these were previously unreported,   and &gt;85% are rare. Our annotation and analysis confirmed and extended previously reported correlations between CNVs and several   genomic features such as repetitive DNA elements, segmental duplications and genes. We demonstrate the utility of this data set   in distinguishing CNVs with pathologic significance from normal variants. Together, this analysis and annotation provides a   useful resource to assist with the assessment of CNVs in the contexts of human variation, disease susceptibility, and clinical   molecular diagnostics.

MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent.</p> <p>Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam to determine coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality.</p> <p>In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by four examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality.</p> <p><b>MESA Family</b><br/> The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the <b>Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)</b> and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia.</p> <p>In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping.</p> <p>The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits. Genotyping and data analysis will occur throughout the study.</p> <p><b>MESA Air</b><br/> The general goal of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (&#39;MESA Air&#39;) is to prospectively examine the relation between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures (including PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease in a multi-city, multi-ethnic cohort. MESA Air will also prospectively examine the relationship between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. MESA AIR is funded by a grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to the University of Washington and subcontracts from the UW to other participating institutions.</p> <p>MESA Air will assess if ambient air pollution is associated with changes over time in subclinical measures of atherosclerosis and plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial activation in a longitudinal data model, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and specific cardiovascular risk factors (such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and diet). The study will similarly assess if the incidence of cardiovascular events is associated with long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, using a proportional hazards model. The study includes refinement of statistical tools, and explores joint/independent effects of acute and long-term pollutant exposure in the occurrence of cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>The MESA Air study is built on the foundation of the ongoing MESA study. The parent MESA Study cohort is located in six geographic areas (&#39;Field Centers&#39;) that capture tremendous exposure heterogeneity, comparable to or greater than the variability in locations of prior U.S. cohort studies. In addition to the six Field Centers, the study involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), ultrasound and air pollution data.</p> <p>The cohort for the MESA Air study currently includes 6226 subjects: 5479 enrolled in the parent MESA study; 257 recruited specifically for this study, and 490 recruited from the MESA Family study. The entire MESA Air cohort will be followed over a 10-year project period for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events.</p> <p>On two occasions over the ten-year study period, 3600 subjects from the MESA Air cohort, residing in nine locales, will undergo computed tomography scanning to assess presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC), and ultrasound of the carotid artery to determine intima-media thickness (IMT). We will also repeatedly assess plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial function in 720 subjects.</p> <p>MESA Air adds state-of-the-art air pollution exposure assessment information to the MESA cohort study, and introduces new subjects and outcome measures to achieve our aims. The study will assess long-term individual-level exposure to ambient air pollutants for each subject using community-scale monitoring, outdoor spatial variation, subject proximity to pollution sources, pollutants&#39; infiltration efficiency, and personal time-activity information. The exposure models will be validated using detailed monitoring in a subset of subjects.</p> <p><b>The MESA Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP substudies.</b> To view genotypes, analysis, expression data, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these substudies, please click on the following substudies below or in the "Substudies" box located on the right hand side of this top-level study page phs000209 MESA Cohort. <ul> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000420">phs000420</a> MESA SHARe</li> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000283">phs000283</a> MESA CARe</li> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000403">phs000403</a> MESA ESP Heart-GO</li> </ul> </p>	Atherosclerosis	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000209.v11.p3

The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI.</p> <p>The WHI has two major parts: a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide.</p> <p>The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are: <ul> <li><b>Hormone Therapy Trials (HT)</b>: This double-blind component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component with an intact uterus were randomized to estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE], 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 2.5 mg/d] or a matching placebo. Women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to CEE or placebo. Both trials were stopped early, in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively, based on adverse effects. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out.</li> <li><b>Dietary Modification Trial (DM)</b>: The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants were randomized to either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern.</li> <li><b>Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD)</b>: This double-blind component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component were randomized to calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D (400 IU/d) supplements or a matching placebo.</li> </ul> </p> <p>The <b>Observational Study (OS)</b> examines the relationship between lifestyle, environmental, medical and molecular risk factors and specific measures of health or disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women not participating in the CT. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed annually for 8 to 12 years.</p> <p>The original protocol allowed for follow-up until March 2005, after which participants were invited to enroll in the first WHI Extension Study for follow-up through 2010. Participants were invited again to participate in the second WHI Extension Study with continued follow up from 2010 to 2015. As of March 31, 2011 there were 93,122 women enrolled in the second extension. As part of the second Extension, 80+ year old women were asked to consent to an In Person Visit at their homes during which additional blood samples were collected and various measurements were taken (such as blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, grip strength, etc).</p> <p><b>The WHI Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP substudies.</b> To view genotypes, analysis, expression data, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these substudies, please click on the following substudies below or in the "Substudies" box located on the right hand side of this top-level study page phs000200 WHI Cohort. <ul> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000386">phs000386</a> WHI SHARe</li> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000281">phs000281</a> GO-ESP WHISP</li> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000315">phs000315</a> WHI GARNET</li> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000503">phs000503</a> WHISE</li> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000227">phs000227</a> PAGE WHI</li> </ul> </p>	Adrenal Gland Neoplasms;Angina Pectoris;Angioplasty, Transluminal, Percutaneous Coronary;Anus Neoplasms;Appendiceal Neoplasms;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Biliary Tract Neoplasms;Bone Neoplasms;Brain Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms;Carotid Artery Diseases;Cataract;Central Nervous System Cysts;Colorectal Neoplasms;Coronary Artery Bypass;Coronary Disease;Diabetes Mellitus;Endocrine Gland Neoplasms;Esophageal Neoplasms;Eye Neoplasms;Fractures, Bone;Gallbladder Diseases;Glaucoma;Heart Failure;Hip Fractures;Hodgkin Disease;Humeral Fractures;Hypertension;Hysterectomy;Intestinal Polyps;Kidney Calculi;Kidney Neoplasms;Laryngeal Neoplasms;Leukemia;Liver Neoplasms;Lung Neoplasms;Lupus Erythematosus, Cutaneous;Lymph Nodes;Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin;Melanoma;Meningeal Neoplasms;Mouth Neoplasms;Multiple Myeloma;Myocardial Infarction;Neoplasms, Connective and Soft Tissue;Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal;Palatal Neoplasms;Pancreatic Neoplasms;Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms;Parotid Neoplasms;Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms;Peripheral Vascular Diseases;Radius Fractures;Respiratory Tract Neoplasms;Salivary Gland Neoplasms;Spinal Cord Neoplasms;Spinal Fractures;Stomach Neoplasms;Stroke;Thyroid Neoplasms;Tibial Fractures;Tongue Neoplasms;Ulna Fractures;Ureteral Neoplasms;Urethral Neoplasms;Urinary Bladder Neoplasms;Urogenital Neoplasms;Uterine Cervical Neoplasms;Uterine Neoplasms	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000200.v8.p2

Acquired copy number alterations (CNA)  were confirmed using an independent, higher resolution, custom array comparative genomic hybridization platform.</p>  <p>A total of 201 somatic CNA were found in the 86 AML genomes (mean 2.34 CNA/genome), with FAB M6 and M7 AML genomes containing the  most changes (10-29 CNA/genome).  Twenty-four percent of AML patients with normal cytogenetics had CNA, while 40% of patients with  an abnormal karyotype had additional CNA detected by SNP array, and several regions contained CNA in multiple AML genomes.  The mRNA expression levels of 57 genes were significantly altered in 27 of 50 recurrent CNA regions &lt;5 megabases in size.  Array data are available online at <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</a>  as GEO accession #GSE10358.  A total of 8 uniparental disomy (UPD) segments were identified in the 86 genomes and 6/8 UPD regions  occurred in samples with a normal karyotype.  Collectively, 40% of AML genomes contained alterations not found with cytogenetics,  and 96% of these regions contained known or novel AML associated genes. 43/86 AML genomes had no CNA or UPD at this level of resolution.  The number of CNA per genome was not associated with overall survival, independent of cytogenetic classification.</p>  <p>In this study of 86 adult AML genomes, subcytogenetic CNAs or UPD did not add prognostic information to standard cytogenetics.

The study leverages a biorepository of blood samples of 1688 PAD  cases and 1649 controls, and the electronic medical record (EMR) to annotate the biorepository.  PAD cases were identified  from the vascular laboratory database as having an ankle brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.9 at rest or after exercise or having  non-compressible vessels. Controls were without prior history of atherosclerotic vascular disease and when tested, no evidence  of ischemia on a stress test. Phenotypes and environmental exposures including age, ethnicity, demographic and anthropometric  data are derived from the Mayo Electronic Medical Record (EMR).  Comorbidities were determined using algorithms for diabetes  and hypertension based on ICD-9 codes and medication use. Relevant laboratory data, including lipid levels, fasting blood  sugar and serum creatinine at index date or within a 1-year window of the index date were extracted. Medication classes  at index date were identified using Mayo&#39;s Natural Language Processing-based system with RxNorm codification and NDF-RT  terminologies mapping. Smoking status was confirmed by natural language processing of clinical notes.

The resources available include highly-characterized, contaminant-free cell   cultures and high quality, well-characterized DNA samples derived from these cultures, both subjected to rigorous quality control.   The Repository was established in 1972 at Coriell and contains more than 9,500 cell lines, primarily fibroblasts and   transformed lymphoblasts. The Repository has a major emphasis on inherited diseases and chromosomally aberrant cell lines.   In addition, it contains a large collection dedicated to understanding human variation that includes samples from populations   around the world, the CEPH collection, the Polymorphism Discovery Resource, Human Variation and many apparently healthy controls.</p>   <p>The Human Variation collection provides cell lines and DNA samples from a variety of populations.  The panels of African-Americans   (HD100AA) and Caucasians (100CAU) used for this study are comprised of samples present in the Repository that were originally   collected over the years  from apparently healthy people to be used as "controls",  for example, unaffected  family members   of persons with identified mono-genetic  diseases.   The samples for the Han people of Los Angeles (HD100CHI) and the Mexican   American Community of Los Angeles (HD100MEX), however, were collected relatively recently from volunteers, identified as   member of these communities, specifically for use in these panels.</p>      <p>The Coriell Genotyping and Microarray Center in conjunction with the NIGMS repository used the Affymetrix Genome-Wide   Human SNP 6.0 platform to genotype 400 samples from the NIGMS human variation panels. The populations genotyped included   Americans of African, Caucasian, Mexican, and Han Chinese ancestry. The Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array detects approximately 940,000   SNPs and provides copy number information for more than 900,000 additional locations across the genome.</p>	Normalcy	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000211.v1.p1

Eight laboratories contributed DNA samples for genotyping at the Broad Institute and association with SLE was performed by the   Data Coordinating Center (Wake Forest University), as part of a four stage study design. Stages one and two of this design   were graciously funded by the <b>Alliance for Lupus Research</b> (<a href="http://www.lupusresearch.org" target="_blank">www.lupusresearch.org</a>).   In this stage of the study, approximately 767 SLE patients (cases) were compared to approximately 383 non-SLE patients (controls)   for differences among the Illumina HumanHap300.

Host  genetic factors have been suggested to play an important role in disease development, but few have been identified.</p>  <p>In this study, we attempted to identify the host genetic factors by performing a two-stage genome-wide association  study (GWAS) in Chinese population.  The initial genome-wide scan was done by genotyping 706 patients and 1225 controls using  the Illumina HumanHap610 BeadChip, and the follow-up study was performed by genotyping 93 SNPs in three independent samples  consisting of 3254 cases and 5955 controls.  We identified significant association (P&lt;10<sup>-10</sup>) within six genes  CCDC122 (13q14), C13orf31 (13q14), NOD2 (16q12), TNFSF15 (9q32), HLA-DR (6p21) and RIPK2 (8q21), and suggestive  association (P=5.68x10<sup>-6</sup>) within LRRK2 (12q12).  We also revealed suggestive evidence for C13orf31, LRRK2,  NOD2 and RIPK2 to show stronger association in the multibacillary form than the paucibacillary form of leprosy.

The study consists of both retrospective and prospective components, that is, patients with an existing diagnosis of Alzheimer&#39;s disease as well as newly diagnosed patients were enrolled in the study. Thus, clinical data was retrospectively or prospectively obtained on Day 1 of entry into GenADA.  Where possible, biological relatives with Alzheimer&#39;s (up to third degree relationship such as cousins) and unaffected siblings of AD cases were also recruited.  Note that recruitment numbers for biological relatives were lower than expected and genotypic data has not been submitted to dbGap for these subjects.</p> <p>The purpose of this study is:<br/> <ul> <li>To identify DNA sequence variations (genotype) in candidate genes that are associated with the clinical symptoms and behavioural features of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (phenotype), which differ between study participants with and without the disease.</li> <li>To identify other genotype-phenotype associations in cognitively impaired study participants such as age of onset, family history, rate of cognitive decline, patterns of behavioural/psychiatric non-cognitive symptoms factors, response to treatment co-morbid conditions, and risks/exposure.</li> </ul> </p> <p>The final subject recruitment for this study included 875 Alzheimer&#39;s disease patients, 850 ethnically-matched controls, and 37 family members.</p> <p>GenADA LONG is a longitudinal assessment to the original GenADA study.  Eligible subjects were recruited from five of the nine memory clinics that participated in the GenADA study.  Mild to moderate AD participants, a matched subset of controls, and biological related siblings (both affected and unaffected) or other blood relatives affected with AD, were initially examined a minimum of 12 months from recruitment into the original GenADA study, then at two further intervals of 12 and 18 months after time of entry into GenADA LONG.  This enables an evaluation of the disease progression in AD patients and a determination of whether controls show evidence of cognitive decline.  The overall goal of this extension study is to identify genetic differences and environmental influences that modulate the age of onset of the disease, the course of the disease, and/or biomarkers for neurodegenerative processes.</p> <p>Three of the five memory clinics that participated in the GenADA LONG study recruited eligible patients into GenADA Imaging.</p> <p>A concurrent neuroimaging sub-study was conducted at three of the five memory clinics participating in GenADA LONG. Eligible AD cases with mild to moderate AD, who were recruited into the original GenADA study and participated in the GenADA LONG extension study, were enrolled.  Additionally, controls that showed signs of cognitive decline, as part of the assessment in GenADA LONG, were imaged at baseline, 12 and 18 month scanning intervals.  The objective of this study is to find genes that: affect changes in AD brain volume measure by magnetic resonance in order to investigate how well change in brain volume predicts other key clinical measures in AD, such as neurodegenerative scales; that correlate changes in brain volume for other genotype-phenotype associations in cognitively impaired study participants; and that correlate with other clinically applicable magnetic resonance measures of pathology that can be conducted at the same time as structural volume measures, and are complementary to the volume measures.</p> <p>The ultimate aim of this research is to obtain a better understanding and definition of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease in order to develop new improved medicines.</p>	Alzheimer Disease	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000219.v1.p1

This cohort study of over 215,000 men and women in Hawaii and  California is unique in that it is population-based and includes large representations of older adults (45-75 yrs at baseline)  for five US racial/ethnic groups (Japanese Americans, African Americans, European Americans, Latinos and Native Hawaiians)  at varying risks of chronic diseases. Within the PAGE investigation, the MEC proposes to study: 1) diseases for which  we have DNA available for large numbers of cases and controls (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, diabetes, and   obesity); 2) important cancers that are less common (e.g., lung, pancreas, endometrial cancers, NHL) but for which we propose   to pool our data with other funded groups; 3) common traits that are risk factors for these diseases (e.g., body mass index/weight,   waist-to-hip ratio, height) and 4) relevant disease-associated biomarkers (e.g., fasting insulin and lipids, steroid hormones). The   specific aims are: 1) To determine the population-based epidemiologic profile (allele frequency, main effect, heterogeneity by disease  characteristics) of putative causal variants in the five racial/ethnic groups in the MEC; 2) for variants displaying effect  heterogeneity across ethnic/racial groups, we will utilize differences in LD to identify a more complete spectrum of associated  variants at these loci; 3) investigate gene x gene and gene x environment interactions to identify modifiers; 4) examine  the associations of putative causal variants with already measured intermediate phenotypes (e.g., plasma insulin, lipids,  steroid hormones); and 5) for variants that do not fall within known genes, start to investigate their relationships with  gene expression and epigenetic patterns in small genomic studies.</p>	Neoplasms;Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus;Obesity;Cholesterol, HDL;Cholesterol, LDL;Triglycerides;Glucose;Insulin	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000220.v1.p1

It was begun in 1992 with the ascertainment of 1,200 families, half randomly sampled, and half selected because of an excess of coronary heart disease (CHD) or risk factor abnormalities as compared with age- and sex-specific population rates (Higgins et al. 1996). The families, with approximately 6,000 individuals, were sampled on the basis of information on probands from four population-based parent studies: the Framingham Heart Study, the Utah Family Tree Study, and two Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) centers (Minneapolis, and Forsyth County, NC). A broad range of phenotypes were assessed at a clinic examination in broad domains of CHD, atherosclerosis, cardiac and vascular function, inflammation and hemostasis, lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure, diabetes and insulin resistance, pulmonary function, and anthropometry (FamHS Visit 1). Approximately 8 years later, study participants belonging to the largest pedigrees were invited for a second clinical exam (FamHS Visit 2). A total of 2,756 Caucasian subjects in 508 extended families were examined.</p> <p>A two-phase design was adopted for the genome wide association (GWA) study. In phase-1, 1007 subjects were chosen, equally distributed between the upper and lower quartile of age- and sex-adjusted values for coronary artery calcification, assessed by CT scan in Visit 2. These subjects were chosen to be largely unrelated; 34% of the subjects were from unique families, while 200 other subjects had 1 or more siblings selected into the sample, yielding a sample of 465 unrelated subjects. The remaining family members (N=1749) were genotyped in the phase-2 for replication of the top hits from the phase-1. The results presented here represent those for the analysis of the phase-1 case-control sample for variables assessed in FamHS Visit 1 (from 1992 to 1995) and for the variables assessed in FamHS Visit 2 (from 2002 to 2003).</p> <p>All subjects were typed on the Illumina HumMap 550 chip (Phase 1 genotype). Of these, 33 (3.3%) were excluded due to technical errors, call rates below 98%, and discrepancies between reported sex and sex-diagnostic markers. The final sample of 974 subjects have Visit 2 phenotypes, approximately 100 of these do not have Visit 1 phenotypes. There was no significant plate-to-plate variation in allele frequencies.</p> <p>The covariate adjustments were performed separately by sex using cubic polynomial age and clinical centers, and retaining the terms in the stepwise regression analysis that were significant at the 5% level. Extreme outliers (&gt;4 SD from the mean) were set aside, temporarily, for the adjustments. The final phenotypes were computed for all individuals using the best mean regression models and standardizing to 0 mean and unit variance.</p> <p>The FamHS has contributed GWA results in many phenotype domains (antropometric and adiposity, atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, lipid profile, diabetes and glicemic traits, metabolic syndrome etc) to meta-analyses and various consortia, including Heard-Costa et al. 2009, K&#246;ttgen et al. 2010, Teslovich et al. 2010, Nettleton et al. 2010, Lango et al. 2010, Heid et al. 2010, Speliotes et al. 2010, Dupuis et al. 2010, Kraja et al. 2011.</p>	Coronary Heart Diseases;Atherosclerosis;Cardiovascular Diseases	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000221.v1.p1

For this GWAS of generalized vitiligo, 579,146 SNPs were genotyped in 1514 generalized vitiligo  cases of European-derived white (CEU) ancestry versus data from 2813 "public" CEU controls.  49 strongly  associated SNPs from the first phase of the GWAS were then tested in two replication studies, one comparing  677 independent cases and 1106 CEU controls, and the other a family-based analysis of 204 CEU simplex  generalized vitiligo trios and 310 CEU multiplex families. Overall, significant association of generalized  vitiligo was detected for SNPs in several genes previously associated with other autoimmune diseases, including  MHC class I (P = 9.05 x 10<sup>-23</sup>) and class II (P = 4.50 x 10<sup>-34</sup>) loci, PTPN22 (P = 1.31 x 10<sup>-7</sup>),  LPP (P = 1.01 x 10<sup>-11</sup>), IL2RA (P = 2.78 x 10<sup>-9</sup>), UBASH3A (P = 1.26 x 10<sup>-9</sup>), and  C1QTNF6 (P = 2.21 x 10<sup>-16</sup>). Association was also detected for SNPs in two novel immune-related loci,  RERE (P = 7.07 x 10<sup>-15</sup>), GZMB (P = 3.44 x 10<sup>-8</sup>), and in a locus that may mediate melanocyte  target cell specificity, TYR (P = 1.60 x 10<sup>-18</sup>) encoding tyrosinase. These findings thus demonstrate  association between generalized vitiligo and multiple genes, some associated with other autoimmune diseases and  others that may mediate target-cell specificity, and suggest a possible inverse relationship between susceptibility  to vitiligo versus melanoma.</p>	Vitiligo	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000224.v1.p1

Consequently, the choice of tissue or cell model in the dissection of   disease associations is important. We carried out an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) study of primary   human osteoblasts (HOb) derived from 95 unrelated donors of Swedish origin, each represented by two independently   derived primary lines to provide biological replication. We combined our data with publicly available information   from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bone mineral density (BMD). The top 2000 BMD-associated SNPs were   tested for cis-association of gene expression in HObs and in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) using publicly   available data and showed that HObs have a significantly greater enrichment (threefold) of converging   cis-eQTLs as compared to LCLs. The top 10 BMD loci with SNPs showing strong cis-effects on gene expression   in HObs were selected for further validation using a staged design in two cohorts of Caucasian male subjects.   All 10 variants were tested in the Swedish MrOS Cohort (n = 3014), providing evidence for two novel BMD loci   (SRR and MSH3). These variants were then tested in the Rotterdam Study (n = 2090), yielding converging evidence   for BMD association at the 17p13.3 SRR locus. The cis-regulatory effect was further fine-mapped to the proximal   promoter of the SRR gene (rs3744270). Our results suggest that primary cells relevant to disease phenotypes   complement traditional approaches for prioritization and validation of GWAS hits for follow-up studies.</p>   <p>Reprinted from Grundberg E, Kwan T, Ge B et al., Genome Res Nov 2009, with permission from Genome Research,   Cold Spring Harbor Press, PMID:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19654370" target="_blank">19654370</a>.</p>	Bone Density;Osteoporosis	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000225.v1.p1

It is one of  5 sites participating in The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network funded by the National Human Genome Research  Institute (NHGRI) with additional funding from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS).  The overall eMERGE  project is designed to assess whether linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical  records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies and whether information can  be pooled across sites.  The primary phenotype in the Group Health/UW Aging and Dementia eMERGE study project is dementia.</p>  <p>Phenotyped participants originated from four population-based sources.  Seattle-area members of GH (a large integrated health  care system in Washington State) consented and enrolled in 1) the University of Washington Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Patient  Registry (ADPR) and 2) the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, 3) Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research  Project (PMRP), a population-based DNA, plasma and serum biobank of 20,000 adults, 4) Vanderbilt&#39;s BioVU, a de-identified  DNA biobank.</p>  <p>The ADPR (PI: Eric B. Larson; NIH/NIA U01 AG 006781) is a population-based registry of incident dementia cases designed to  identify all new dementia cases within GH from 1987 to 1996.  Potential dementia cases were identified through referrals from  primary care physicians, mental health services, and neurologists, as well as review of CT scans, neurology, emergency room,  geriatrician, and mental health clinic logs, and hospital discharge diagnoses.  Medical history, physical, laboratory testing,  and neuropsychological testing were performed on all consenting potential cases.  These data were reviewed by a consensus  conference including a neuropsychologist, study physicians, and an epidemiologist.  After discussion of the case, dementia  status is assigned using DSM-III-R criteria.  Alzheimer&#39;s disease status was assigned using the National Institute of  Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer&#39;s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA)  criteria.  The study base of the ADPR population was stable with an attrition rate of less than 1%/year.</p>  <p>The ACT study (PI: Eric B. Larson; NIH/NIA U01 AG 006781) is an ongoing community-based cohort study designed to determine  the incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease (AD), other types of dementia, and cognitive impairment and to determine risk factors  for these conditions.  The original cohort of 2,581 was enrolled in 1994-1996.  An expansion cohort of 811 was enrolled  in 2000-2002.  Continuous enrollment to keep 2,000 persons enrolled and at-risk for dementia outcomes was begun in 2005.  To date the study has accrued more than 4,000 participants.  Dementia-free participants are enrolled in this cohort and  evaluated every two years by study personnel with many evaluations including an assessment of cognitive functioning  using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), which is an extended version of the Mini-Mental State  Examination that has been widely used in epidemiological studies of the elderly.  Persons with CASI scores lower  than 86 or in whom interviewers suspect unusual cognitive decline are followed up with dementia diagnostic evaluations  which include physical and neurological examinations and neuropsychological tests.  Medical records are reviewed, and  laboratory tests and neuroimaging are obtained if not available.  The dementia diagnoses and dementia subtypes are  determined during a consensus conference attended by the examining clinicians and other study physicians, a neuropsychologist,  and research nurse.  After discussion of the case, dementia status is assigned using DSM-IV criteria.  Alzheimer&#39;s disease  status was assigned using NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.  Individuals diagnosed with dementia are seen again one year following diagnosis  using the same procedures.  Individuals not diagnosed with dementia are returned to the pool of at-risk individuals and are  seen at their next routinely scheduled biennial visit.  The ACT sub-sample is stable; for the original cohort, median  enrollment in GH was 19 years prior to joining the ACT study, and 85% of the cohort has &#8805; 10 years of GH enrollment.</p>  <p>DNA for the ADPR participants were obtained through a companion study, Genetic Differences in Cases and Controls  (PI: Walter Kukull; NIH/NIA R01 AG007584).  DNA obtained through both studies were extracted from blood using Gentra  Systems Puregene methods.  DNA concentration is determined by UV optical density. All samples are checked for quality  by OD 260/280 ratio.  For long-term storage, samples are aliquoted and stored at -70&#176;C.</p>  <p>The Marshfield study, Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP), a population-based DNA, plasma and serum biobank  of 20,000 adults. PMRP was started in 2002 as a 3 Phase project.  Completed in April 2004, the objectives of Phase I were  to build and develop a large population-based biobank with DNA, plasma and serum samples to facilitate genomics research.  Phase 1 was also to educate, inform and consult with the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area population and communities  concerning potential studies, create the DNA foundation of the personalized medicine database and build the bioinformatics  tools to store securely and analyze genotypic and phenotypic data. Phase I tasks included operation of the ethics and  security advisory board, scientific advisory board and community advisory group. More than 18,000 residents aged 18 and  above from 19 different zip codes surrounding Marshfield, WI were invited to participate in Phase I.  After providing  written informed consent, participants completed brief questionnaires that included questions about demographics, some  environmental exposures, family history of disease, and adverse drug reactions, as well as family members living in the  area.  Participants provided 50ml of blood from which DNA was extracted and plasma and serum samples were stored. The  informed consent process allowed access to electronic medical records and included language about non-disclosure of personal  research results.  A tick-off box was included so that participants could either allow or decline subsequent recontact for  future research studied.  The objectives of Phase II are to create the phenotypic database, establish the scientific and  administrative infrastructure to support genetic mapping of the DNA and the initial discovery projects and genotype a  sufficient portion of the genetic material to support these discovery projects. The objectives of Phase III are to expand  the discovery projects, complete the genotyping of the genetic database and expand physician/health care provider education  and community consultation.</p>  <p>The Vanderbilt BioVU model uses discarded blood leftover from clinical care and de-identified clinical information, both  of which are tracked with a Research Unique Identifier that is permanently disconnected from the medical record number used to  generate it. The Vanderbilt IRB determined that the project does not qualify as "human subject" research under &#167;46.102(f)(1)(2).  The program has been reviewed by OHRP twice (the latest immediately prior to launch), and the determination of the Vanderbilt  IRB that the project is consistent with the 8/10/2004 guidance has been validated.  The model includes a simple opt out mechanism  developed for patients who do not wish to have their samples included. Planning (including community involvement, ethics and  IRB discussions, focus groups, development of operating procedures and pilot studies to assess them) began in May 2004, and  the resource commenced sample collection in February 2007 and as of May 2009 contains approximately 56,000 samples. The current  resource will be available to all Vanderbilt investigators who sign a Data Use Agreement. The resource represents Vanderbilt&#39;s  broad patient population and thus provides a potential resource for research in a range of common and rare diseases as well as  drug response or medication safety.</p>  <p>BioVU patient protection model: There has been extensive involvement by the ethics community and the IRB to put in place  procedures to provide privacy protection. The overall protection plan is multifaceted and includes a combination of technology  and policy: (1) creation of the SD described above; (2) return of only the specific clinical data items requested by  investigators (rather than the complete de-identified chart); (3) submission of any specific proposed project to the IRB  and to a separate protocol review committee, both of which must approve; (4) implementing a Data Use Agreement that permits  only approved queries and data analyses, specifically prohibits attempts at re-identification (at the risk of institutional  sanctions), and mandates redeposit of all genetic information generated in a research study back into a genomic database;  and (5) tracking and auditing all use.</p>	Dementia;Alzheimer Disease;Aging;Aged;Age Factors	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000234.v1.p1

The CGCI program includes comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors.</p> <p>CGCI is currently characterizing a number of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from patients with and without HIV+ infection, follicular lymphoma (FL), as well as adult and pediatric Burkitt lymphomas), medulloblastoma (MB), additional HIV-associated tumors (including lung and cervical cancers), and early stage lung cancers; additional tumor types to be characterized in the future. All data from these projects will be released into publicly accessible databases, with a majority of data in an open-access tier. A subset of data will be available only through a controlled-access tier due to patient privacy concerns.</p> <p><b>Individual project descriptions are available by disease on the substudy pages, (can be found on the righthand side of this page), however brief summaries are as follows:</b> <ul> <li><b>Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)</b> - CGCI investigators are probing genomic alterations more deeply than has been previously possible by using state-of-the-art RNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) and whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) coupled with leading edge bioinformatics, data management and analysis approaches. To date the project has sequenced tumor DNA and/or RNA from 117 NHL tumor samples and 10 cell lines. This includes the genomes or exomes of 1 Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and 13 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases, all with matched constitutional DNA sequenced to comparable depths, RNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq) of 92 DLBCL, 12 FL and 8 B-cell NHL cases with other histologies and 10 DLBCL-derived cell lines. The DLBCL cases and cell-lines are from the two major subtypes of DLBCL: germinal center B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC).</li><br/> <li><b>Medulloblastoma (MB)</b> - In order to identify the genetic alterations in MB, copy number alterations were sought using high-density microarrays and sequenced all known protein-coding genes and miRNA genes using Sanger sequencing in a set of 22 pediatric MB samples and one matched normal blood sample. All tumor samples were obtained at the time of original surgery (pre-treatment) except for one sample, which was obtained at the time of MB recurrence. The protein encoding transcripts were supplemented with microRNA transcripts downloaded from the Sanger miRBase Sequence Database (Release 13.0) in order to yield a combined set of transcripts representing 24,893 genes (24,178 protein encoding and 715 microRNA). The regions of interest (ROIs) targeted for sequencing comprised the entire transcribed portion of the microRNA exons and the protein encoding portion plus 4 bases of flanking sequence for the protein encoding exons. Illumina Infinium II Whole Genome Genotyping Assay employing the BeadChip platform was used to analyze the same set of tumor samples at 1,199,187 (1M-Duo) SNP loci in order to detect copy number alterations in the same set of tumors.</li><br/> <li><b>HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP)</b> - This project is a joint effort of the Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) and the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM). Its goals are to characterize HIV-associated cancers (obtained from HIV-infected patients) and compare them to the same types of cancers from patients without HIV infection. Investigators will perform 30X genome sequencing of 100 cases of paired tumor and germline DNA, along with transcriptome sequencing in each of 3 types of HIV+ tumors (DLBCL, lung and cervical cancers). These platforms allow discovery of mutations both in coding and non-coding genomic regions, gene expression and genomic alterations (including translocations, insertions and deletions). Comparing tumors of cancer patients both with and without HIV-infection will provide insight into the potential function of this virus in certain cancers.</li><br/> <li><b>Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP)</b> - This project is a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute and the Foundation for Burkitt Lymphoma Research to develop a databank of the many alterations found in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), an uncommon type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs most often in children and young adults. The goal of the BLGSP is to explore potential genetic changes in patients with BL that could lead to better prevention, detection and treatment of the cancer. The project will characterize the alterations of the tumors&#39; genomes (with matched normal as control) and transcriptomes by sequencing the DNA and RNA of each case. Using the data generated, the ultimate goals of the project are to discover the molecular changes that are present in BL patients and then determine how those changes correlate with treatment regimen and outcome.</li> </ul> </p> <p><u>Other Grants Administered by OCG:</u> <ul> <li><b>RC1 Human Lung Carcinogenesis</b> - Investigators will pursue the identification of transcriptome and epigenome loci that categorize to pathologically-confirmed normal, dysplastic, and malignant epithelial phenotypes in an intra-individual comparison. Initial discovery transcriptome, and epigenome-wide marks of possible phenotypic significance will be verified and refined with high density epigenetic reference techniques. This in turn will yield candidate pathway approaches to be pursued in future prospective biomarker studies aimed at risk assessment, early diagnosis, and targeted therapies. For the genome-wide phases, the surgically-resected, snap frozen human lung tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from &gt;25 donors will be utilized. The mRNA levels will be surveyed using expression microarrays, and then verified by laboratory-developed RNA-specific mRNA-PCR. Methylome-wide HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment Ligation-mediated PCR (HELP-seq by massively parallel sequencing) assay will be used to explore the epigenome, with phenotype-differentiating loci verified by deeper sequencing using mass spectroscopy-based sequencing (MassArray&#174;) and re-verified at key loci using the laboratory-developed tagged bisulfite genomic sequencing (tBGS). MicroRNA-seq by parallel sequencing will be used to assay the micronome, verified by both microRNA-qPCR and microRNA pull-down as developed in the Spivack laboratory.</li> </ul> </p> <p>As described above, the projects currently involved in CGCI will provide various data to include whole genomic, transcriptomic and mutational analyses of the tumor types being studied. This page will be amended as additional projects and characterization platforms are added to the CGCI portfolio.</p>	Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse;Lymphoma, Follicular;Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin;Lymphomas, Histiocytic;Medulloblastoma;Lymphoma, AIDS-Related;Lung Neoplasms;Uterine Cervical Neoplasms	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000235.v5.p1

A majority of the group has been examined at each of the follow-up examinations (90%, 86%, 81%, 79%, 74%, and 72%, respectively).</p> <p>While the specifics of each examination has differed somewhat, data have been collected on a variety of factors believed to be related to heart disease. These include conditions with clear links to heart disease such as blood pressure, cholesterol and other lipids. Data have also been collected on physical measurements such as weight and skinfold fat as well as lifestyle factors such as substance use (tobacco and alcohol), dietary and exercise patterns, behavioral and psychological variables, medical and family history, and other chemistries (e.g., insulin and glucose). In addition, subclinical atherosclerosis was measured via echocardiography during Years 5 and 10, computed tomography during Years 15 and 20, and carotid ultrasound during Year 20. A detailed description of the study and results from the first examination are summarized in Cutter et al (Controlled Clinical Trials, Volume 12, Number 1 [supplement], pages 1S-77S, 1991).</p>	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus;Obesity;Cholesterol, HDL;Cholesterol, LDL;Coronary Disease;Triglycerides;Myocardial Infarction;C-Reactive Protein;Gout;Uric Acid;Kidney;Stroke;Hypertension;Respiratory Tract Diseases	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000236.v1.p1

In multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating disease that commonly causes neurodegeneration and disability in young adults,   disease discordance in MZ twins has been interpreted to indicate environmental importance in pathogenesis. However, genetic and epigenetic   differences between MZ twins have been described, challenging the accepted experimental paradigm in disambiguating effects of nature and   nurture.  Here, we report the genome sequences of one MS-discordant MZ twin pair and messenger RNA (mRNA) transcriptome and epigenome   sequences of CD4+ lymphocytes from three MS-discordant, MZ twin pairs. No reproducible differences were detected between co-twins   among ~3.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or ~0.2 million insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels). Nor were any   reproducible differences observed between siblings of the three twin pairs in HLA haplotypes, confirmed MS-susceptibility SNPs, copy   number variations, mRNA and genomic SNP and indel genotypes, or expression of ~19,000 genes in CD4+ T cells. Only two to 176 differences   in methylation of ~2 million CpG sites were detected between siblings of the three twin pairs, in contrast to ~800 differences in   methylation between T cells of unrelated individuals and several thousand differences between tissues or normal and cancerous tissues.   In the first systematic effort to estimate sequence variation among MZ co-twins, we did not find evidence for genetic, epigenetic or   transcriptome differences that explained disease discordance. These are the first female, twin and autoimmune disease genome sequences   reported.</p>	Multiple Sclerosis;Lung Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000239.v2.p1

A total of 1,636 individuals with  ocular hypertension between 40 and 80 years old were enrolled in the study. In addition to ocular hypertension, subjects  in the OHTS were required to have normal optic nerve appearance as determined by the OHTS Optic Disc Reading Center and  normal and reliable visual field tests at the time of enrollment by the OHTS Visual Field Reading Center. OHTS subjects  were randomly assigned to either an observational group which received close observation or a topical medication group    which received medication as needed to achieve a 20% reduction in IOP from their baseline levels. Subjects then were examined at  regular intervals for optic disc cupping or visual field defects. Other clinical measures were also obtained from OHTS  subjects including central corneal thickness (CCT) and intraocular pressure. The primary outcome monitored for the OHTS  was the development of glaucoma in one or both eyes as defined by reproducible visual field abnormality or reproducible  optic disc deterioration attributed to POAG by the masked OHTS Endpoint Committee. The OHTS study design has been reported in  detail (Gordon, 1999; PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10326953" target="_blank">10326953</a>).</p>  <p>The OHTS confirmed that ocular hypertension is a risk factor for developing POAG and showed that lowering IOP reduced  the risk for developing POAG (Kass, 2002; PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12049574" target="_blank">12049574</a>).  The OHTS also demonstrated that thin CCT is a significant risk factor for the  development of POAG (Gordon, 2002; PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12049575" target="_blank">12049575</a>).</p>  <p>Blood samples were also collected from 1,077 OHTS participants for an ancillary genetics study. DNA was prepared from  these samples and used in a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) designed to identify genetic factors that control the  magnitude of quantitative features of glaucoma (baseline IOP, baseline cup-to-disc ratio, and CCT).

We describe the    complete genome sequence analysis of four DNA samples from a 44-year old African-American patient with basal-like breast cancer:    peripheral blood, the primary tumor, a brain metastasis that developed within a year of initial therapy, and a first-passage    xenograft derived from the primary tumor. A total of 50 validated mutations were discovered within coding, RNA, or splice site    sequences. Of these, 20 mutations were abundantly present in all three tumors, including mutations in <i>CSMD1</i> and <i>JAK2</i>.    These two genes subsequently were found to be mutated in other breast tumors. The metastasis contained two <i>de novo</i> mutations    not present in the primary tumor, and was significantly enriched for 20 shared mutations, suggesting that they may be involved    in the metastatic process. The xenograft contained no unique coding, RNA, or splice site mutations and retained all primary tumor    mutations, albeit at different frequencies. However, a significant increase in copy number alterations was observed in the xenograft    as compared to the primary tumor. We validated 28 large deletions and six inversions, as well as seven translocations in at least    one of the three tumor samples. Among them, a 26 kb deletion in <i>MECR</i> was solely identified, assembled, and validated in the    brain metastasis and two overlapping large deletions on chromosome 5 encompassing <i>CTNNA1</i>, a potential tumor suppressor gene,    were identified in all three tumors. The differential mutation frequencies and structural variation patterns between primary and    metastatic tumors suggest that metastatic tumors may arise from minor subpopulations of cells within the primary. Namely, the    metastatic and xenografting processes apparently select for cells harboring a distinct subset of the primary tumor mutation    repertoire.</p>	Breast Neoplasms;Neoplasms;Transplantation, Heterologous	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000245.v1.p1

phs000251.v1.p1	Evaluation of the Cutaneous Microbiome in Psoriasis	93	Case-Control	454 GS FLX Titanium	Microbiome Sequencing	\N	\N	\N	\N	<p>Psoriasis, a highly prevalent disease of humans of unknown cause, is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily involving  skin, with distinctive clinical characteristics. With the newly developed tools that facilitate microbiome research, it now  is possible to assess whether the cutaneous microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Preliminary data  from our studies suggest that the cutaneous microbiome in psoriasis is complex and possibly different from normal. To deal  with this complexity, we propose to examine the cutaneous microbiome in relation to psoriasis with explorations at several  taxonomic and informatic levels. Our overall objective is to examine how changes in the normal cutaneous microbiome contribute  to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Since causality is complex and often difficult to prove, and beyond the scope of this RFP,  our overall hypothesis is that there are alterations in the cutaneous microbiome in areas of skin affected by psoriasis in  comparison with the range observed in clinically unaffected areas, or in healthy persons. We also hypothesize that the  characteristics of the microbiome may affect clinical responses to the immunomodulatory agents used to treat psoriasis.  An alternative hypothesis is that effective treatment of psoriasis with systemic immunomodulatory agents will not substantially  affect the disordered microbial ecosystem.  Such observations would provide evidence for the roles of the microbiota in this  disorder. Since an important consideration in microbiome research is the optimal level (e.g. phylum, genus, species, strain,  gene) at which to examine a scientific question, and we are not yet certain what are the optimal levels for psoriasis,  this also will be examined. Our studies of psoriasis should allow development of both approaches and tools that will have  general utility for Microbiome research. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To understand  the cutaneous microbiome species composition overlaying psoriatic lesions; 2) To investigate differences in metagenome  content for psoriatic lesions compared to normal skin; 3) To identify differences in the transcriptional profiles of the  microbiome and the host between normal skin and psoriatic lesions using high-throughput sequencing; and 4. To estimate the  effects of systemic immunomodulatory therapy for psoriasis on microbiome composition. In total, these studies should help  us understand the role of the microbiome in psoriasis pathogenesis.     </p>	Psoriasis	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000251.v1.p1

Analysis of this problem is greatly complicated by the fact that multiple factors influence the composition of the gut microbiota, including diet, host genotype, and disease state. For example, data from us and others document a drastic impact of diet on the composition of the gut microbiome. No amount of sequencing will yield a useful picture of the role of the microbiota in disease if samples are confounded with uncontrolled variables.</p> <p>We aim to characterize the composition of the gut microbiome while controlling for diet, host genotype, and disease state. Diet is controlled by analyzing children treated for Crohn&#39;s disease by placing them on a standardized elemental diet, and by testing effects of different diets on the gut microbiome composition in adult volunteers. Genotype is analyzed by large scale SNP genotyping, which is already underway and separately funded--team member Hakon Hakonarson is currently genotyping 50 children a week at ~half a million loci each and investigating connections with inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical status is ascertained in the very large IBD practice in the UPenn/CHOP hospital system. Effects of diet, host genotype, and disease state on the gut microbiome are summarized in a multivariate model, allowing connections between microbiome and disease to be assessed free of confounding factors.</p> <p>This project is divided into four sub-studies. In the Fecal Storage Methods (FSM) study, methods of stool storage and DNA extraction are compared to examine their impact on DNA sequence analysis results.

We hypothesize that  genetic factors that affect Paneth cell function, contribute to compositional changes in intestinal microbiota.  These changes in microbiota may lead to reduction of protective commensal organisms and increased numbers of  aggressive organisms that incite intestinal inflammation. This hypothesis is being tested by high throughput 16S  rRNA sequence analysis of de-identified ileal and colonic tissues that have been archived at Washington University  St. Louis, University of North Carolina, Mount Sinai Hospital and the Cleveland Clinic.  Multivariate analysis of  the metagenomic data will be conducted with genotyping metadata (highly reproducible CD risk alleles, including NOD2  and ATG16L1) and phenotyping metadata (e.g. age, gender, race, body mass index, medications and smoking.)</p>  <p>Shotgun sequencing will be performed on selected fecal specimens linked to ileal tissues to identify additional,  or auxiliary, or synergistic pathogenic factors or other functional changes in the microbiome. Because members of  this research team have observed that a chronic viral infection is required for the Paneth cell defect in Atg16l1  hypomorphic mice, a major focus of these studies will be towards identifying potential viral triggers for the  defective Paneth cell phenotype in individuals harboring the ATG16L1 risk allele.  Novel genetic probes for  protective and aggressive organisms will be developed by mining bacterial genome and shotgun sequencing data.  Genomic sequences will be produced for candidate protective and aggressive strains (e.g. adherent-invasive  strains of E. coli) isolated from human intestinal tissues where there is limited existing genome information.  Quantitative qPCR assays using the novel as well as established genetic probes will be conducted to test the  hypothesis that an imbalance between protective and aggressive organisms is associated with genetic factors that  affect Paneth cell function.</p>  <p>Our combined expertise in multiple disciplines across multiple institutions, our demonstrated ability to collect  a large number of well-phenotyped samples with longitudinal clinical information that will be linked to host  response and morphologic studies, and our consortium&#39;s capacity for high-throughput sequencing will be  used to investigate how alterations in human microbiome relate to CD risk alleles and CD pathogenesis.</p>	Crohn Disease;Colitis, Ulcerative	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000255.v1.p1

This surface is colonized by bacteria and other microorganisms which, through a variety of mechanisms serve to further protect the host from invasion by pathogens. Alterations in the normal vaginal microflora, particularly those associated with bacterial vaginosis, are thought to contribute to risk of spontaneous pregnancy loss in the second trimester and spontaneous preterm birth. Additionally, alterations in the vaginal microbiome may increase the likelihood of transmission of certain agents including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). There are physiologic alterations in host condition (e.g., menopause and pregnancy), which are beginning to be investigated as potential selective conditions for change in the "normal" flora, and their impact on disease susceptibility and transmission remains to be more definitively elucidated. The effects of chronically abnormal physiologic states (e.g., diabetes mellitus) on normal vaginal flora have not been well described or studied. Finally, an almost unexplored area of inquiry is the genetic contribution, including race/ethnicity, to the establishment and maintenance of a "normal" vaginal flora, under normal and physiologically altered circumstances. Our research will shed light on how the vaginal microbiome contributes to adverse obstetrical outcomes and sexually transmitted infections in diverse populations. This project addresses the following questions:</p> <p><b>First: Do the genes of the host contribute to the composition of the vaginal microbiome?</b> We hypothesize that a woman&#39;s genetic composition significantly affects the ability of certain commensal, parasitic and pathogenic microbes to colonize and/or infect the genital tract. Thus, we will compare and quantify the microbial populations inhabiting the vaginas of monozygotic and dizygotic twins from the Mid Atlantic Twin Registry, and, in the process, address the question of whether there is a relationship between the microbiomes of the vagina, mouth and GI tract.</p> <p><b>Second: What changes in the vaginal microbiome are associated with common physiological perturbations or non-infectious pathological states of the host?</b>We hypothesize that "altered" physiologic (pregnancy, menopause) and pathologic (chronic disease, hysterectomy) conditions, or environmental "exposures" (exogenous hormones, antibiotics, chronic immunosuppressant, smoking; douching) can predictably alter the vaginal microenvironment. These alterations will lead to changes in microbial populations within the vagina. Changes in the microbial populations may have impacts, positive or more likely negative, on the spontaneous and future well-being of the affected individual. We are characterizing the effects of these "altered" physiologic and pathologic conditions, and environmental exposures, on the composition of the vaginal microbiome.</p> <p><b>Third: What changes in the vaginal microbiome are associated with relevant infectious diseases and conditions?</b> We are testing the hypothesis that infectious diseases predictably alter the vaginal microbiome, and that these changes have an impact on the disease susceptibility, process, and outcome. A predilection for bacterial vaginosis, vaginitis, HIV infection, or other sexually transmitted diseases, is likely associated with a women&#39;s vaginal microbial composition. Thus, we will characterize samples from women with a variety of these infectious conditions to determine the contribution of their micriobiomes to the disease process and susceptibility.</p> <p>We are addressing these questions using a combination of high throughput &#39;nextgen&#39; sequencing technologies, including the Roche 454 FLX and the upgraded Illumina Genome Analyzer II instruments currently installed in the Nucleic Acids Research Facilities at VCU. Thus, segments of the 16S rRNA genes will be amplified from the complex samples taken from various target sites in and around the vagina of each study participant. These segments will be sequenced and subjected to taxonomic classification protocols to identify and quantify the bacterial taxa present in each sample. Additionally, total DNA isolated from these samples will be subjected to shotgun sequence analysis to empirically reconstruct the metabolic potential of these microbiomes. Finally, specific bacterial clones will be completely sequenced and analyzed to associate the unavoidable strain and isolate diversity with the clinical phenotypes presented.</p>	\N	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000256.v2.p2

The incidence of EA has  increased 6-fold in the U.S. since the 1970s, parallel to a significant increase in the prevalence of gastroesophageal  reflux diseases (GERD). Although specific host factors might predispose one to disease risk, such a rapid increase in  incidence must be predominantly environmental. The cause remains unknown. Our hypothesis is that changes in the  foregut microbiome are associated with EA and its precursors, RE and BE in the GERD sequence.</p>  <p>We will conduct a case control study to demonstrate the microbiome-disease association in every stage of GERD  sequence as well as analyze the trend in changes in the microbiome along disease progression toward EA.</p>  <p>Specific Aim 1. To conduct a comprehensive population survey of the foregut microbiome and demonstrate its  association with GERD sequence, by 16S rRNA gene survey. We will analyze samples of the foregut microbiome at  three anatomic loci: mouth, distal esophagus, and gastric corpus. Changes of the microbiota in the distal  esophagus will be correlated with the phenotypes. Spatial relationship between the esophageal microbiota and  upstream (mouth) and downstream (stomach) foregut microbiotas as well as temporal stability of the  microbiome-disease association will also be examined.</p>  <p>Specific Aim 2. To define distal esophageal metagenome and demonstrate its association with GERD sequence,  by shotgun metagenomic analysis. We will first classify samples of the metagenome into metagenotypes by  between-sample k-mer distance and correlate the metagenotypes with the four phenotypes. Subsequent detailed analyses  will include pathway-disease and gene-disease associations. DNA viruses and fungi, if identified, also will be  correlated with the phenotypes.</p>  <p>A significant association between the foregut microbiome and GERD sequence, if demonstrated, will be the  first step for eventually testing the causal hypothesis that an abnormal microbiome is required for the development  of the sequence of phenotypic changes toward EA.</p>  <p>If EA and its precursors represent a microbial ecological disease, treating the cause of GERD might become  possible, for example, by normalizing the microbiome through use of antibiotics, probiotics, or prebiotics.

Pouchitis is an inflammatory condition of the surgically-created ileoanal pouch that serves as a pseudo-rectum in patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone a total colectomy. It is a condition unique to ulcerative colitis (UC), as it rarely occurs in non-UC patients who have the same procedure. Within one year, about 50% of patients will develop pouchitis. The condition is almost certainly due to aspects of the pouch microbiota on a background of genetic susceptibility, as most patients respond to treatment with antibiotics. While there have been reports on the microbiota in pouchitis patients, all have been performed after the inflammatory process is initiated, rendering interpretation of the results difficult, as the inflammatory process itself will change the microbiota.</p> <p><b>Our project is therefore unique and possibly the only opportunity in the role of the enteric microbiome in IBD in a prospective manner, thereby establishing potentially important causal relationships between microbiota structure or function and development of UC.</b> The studies also offer two additional advantages. First, the development of the pouch microbiota can be observed prospectively. Second, the cause of antibiotic treatment failure in some patients with pouchitis may be revealed. The two aims are (1) to identify causal factors in the structure and/or function of the enteric microbiota in the development of pouchitis, and (2) to determine the basis of treatment failure in UC pouchitis patients. Our analyses will include serial measurements of enteric microbial structure (16S rRNA gene-based), function (metagenomics and functional candidate genes), and cultivation, the latter to enhance interpretation of gene sequences derived from metagenomes and targeted gene surveys (either functional or 16S genes).</p> <p>The insights gained from these studies will help us understand the fundamental and causative roles of the enteric microbiome in human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).

This study will expand the scope of the investigation to include viruses, which account for a substantial proportion of infectious disease morbidity and mortality, especially in children. The long-term goal of this project is to describe the human virome in children and to investigate its relevance to febrile illnesses in children. The project will also seek to understand the relationship of the immune system to the composition of the virome. Thus, the project&#39;s specific aims are 1) To elucidate the spectrum of viruses that can be detected using non-biased, high throughput sequencing on samples of blood, respiratory, and gastrointestinal secretions from healthy children and to use this information as a basis for understanding the role of viruses in acute febrile illnesses without an obvious source, and 2) to investigate the effect of various forms of immunosuppression on the spectrum of viruses detected in children, and to use this information as a basis for understanding the role of viruses in acute febrile illnesses occurring in these children. Our preliminary studies show that diverse viruses can be detected in children having undiagnosed fever. To carry out the specific aims, well children will be enrolled prior to having elective surgery, and febrile otherwise well children will be enrolled from the Emergency Department at St. Louis Children&#39;s Hospital. Immunocompromised children will be recruited from hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant clinics, the HIV/AIDS clinic, and the rheumatology/immunology clinic from the same hospital. Children with fever will have samples obtained at the time of the febrile illness and at 1 and 6-month follow-up visits. Selected samples from each study group will be analyzed at the Genome Center at Washington University (GCWU) using next generation 454 high throughput sequencing to detect and sequence all viral sequences present. We anticipate detecting and sequencing a broad range of viruses, including previously unrecognized agents. A variety of techniques will be used to investigate the significance of viruses detected. Virus-specific PCR assays will be used to determine the frequency and extent of viruses detected by sequencing, using the full range of samples collected. Host response to the detected viruses will be investigated using serologic analysis, cytokine profiling, and microarrays to characterize host gene expression. These studies will take advantage of follow-up samples to compare the acute response with the response in the convalescent period. This study will draw upon the expertise and technological assets of one of the world&#39;s most powerful sequencing centers to provide the research community with a comprehensive sequence data base of the viruses that are present in children, which can be used to improve our understanding of the causes of febrile illnesses in young children, many of which are currently undiagnosed.</p>	Fever of Unknown Origin;Viruses	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000264.v2.p1

The overall goal is to obtain a robust knowledge-base of the intestinal microbiome in children without  evidence of pain or gastrointestinal disease, children with functional abdominal pain, and children with abdominal pain  and changes in bowel habits (irritable bowel syndrome).  Multiple strategies have been deployed to navigate and understand  the nature of the intestinal microbiome in childhood. These strategies include 454 pyrosequencing-based strategies to  sequence 16S rRNA genes and understand the detailed composition of microbes in healthy and disease groups. Microarray-based  hybridization with the PhyloChip and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) probes are being applied as complementary strategies  to gain an understanding of the intestinal microbiome from various perspectives.

Atopic dermatitis (AD, "eczema") is a chronic relapsing skin disorder that affects ~15% of  U.S. children and is associated with $1 billion of medical costs annually. AD is characterized by dry, itchy skin,  infiltrated with immune cells. Colonization by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is ten-fold more common in AD  patients and is associated with disease flares. We hypothesize that, in addition to S. aureus, AD may also be  associated with additional novel microbes and/or selective shifts of commensal microbes that are relevant to  disease progression. The NISMC seeks to define the microbiota that resides in and on the skin and nares of three  patient groups, all of whom have eczematous lesions and are currently seen at the NIH Clinical Center: (1) AD  patients; (2) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients; and (3) Hyper IgE syndrome (HIES) patients.  Examination of the microbiome of patients with WAS or HIES syndromes, both rare immunodeficiencies, will  advance our understanding of how an individual&#39;s immune system shapes their cutaneous microbial community. We  are performing a prospective longitudinal study that follows these groups of patient thorough the cycles of  eczema flares, ascertaining clinical data and samples at each stage.</p>	Dermatitis, Atopic;Jobs Syndrome;Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000266.v2.p1

To understand the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity in ASDs, we analyzed over 1,500 strictly defined ASD families with over 1,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and applied multiple analytical strategies to examine these families for SNPs and Copy Number Variation (CNVs) affecting risk for ASDs. Secondary analyses examined associations in more homogenous subgroups. Furthermore, the use of large control datasets permitted contrasting case and control samples and addressed the potential increased burden of rare CNVs in ASD. Our data have allowed us to discern key features of the ASD genomic architecture, find new susceptibility loci, and chart a course for future studies in ASDs.</p>	Autism Spectrum Disorder	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000267.v2.p2

The resources available include highly-characterized, contaminant-free fibroblast cell lines, transformed lymphoblastoid   cell lines (LCLs), and DNA samples derived from these cultures. While the Repository has a major emphasis on inherited   diseases, it also contains large collections of cell lines gathered from populations around the world that are intended   for use in facilitating the understanding of human variation. Prominent among these resources is the CEPH Reference   Family collection contributed by the Centre d&#39;Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (<a href="http://landru.cephb.fr/" target="_blank">CEPH</a>),   Foundation Jean Dausset, Paris, France. The CEPH collection includes families collected by R. White (Utah),   J. Dausset (French), J. Gusella (Venezuelan), and J. Egeland (Amish). There are a total of 809 individuals   accounting for 832 pedigree positions in the reference families. Family relationships for the 61 reference   families were verified at Coriell and approved by CEPH. In an effort to enhance the value of this cell culture   resource available from the Repository, the Coriell Genotyping and Microarray Center used the Affymetrix   Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform to genotype 181 samples from the NIGMS HGCR CEPH collection.

We use the distinguishing nucleotide characteristics of human-specific L1 elements to resequence the L1 3&#39; flanking regions thus locating the L1 insertion sites whether or not they are present in the reference genome assembly. In doing so, we have uncovered a higher than expected number of non-reference L1 insertions, an average of 152 insertions per individual. In addition, we find that any two individuals differ at an average of 285 sites with respect to presence or absence of L1 insertions in those sites, and use this to estimate the rate of retrotransposition in humans at 1 event per 140 live births (95% c.i. 1/95 to 1/270). We show that individual &#39;L1 profiles&#39; recapitulate genetic ancestry as expected, and find that dimorphic insertions are more frequent in introns relative to fixed insertions.</p>	Normalcy	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000273.v1.p1
phs000274.v1.p1	Genome-Wide Association Study of Celiac Disease	2300	Case-Control	Human660W-Quad_v1_A	GWAS	Not specified	\N	\N	\N	<p>Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy, celiac sprue) is a common disease with significant morbidity and mortality.  It is caused by sensitivity to the dietary protein gluten, resulting in a chronic enteropathy in the small intestine.  Celiac  disease is now recognized to be a common disease, with reports that the disease frequency is 1:133 in the United States,  similar to European estimates.  There is recent evidence to suggest that the incidence of the disease is rising. Occult  disease is frequently present with minimal classic symptoms or signs. The ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic celiac  disease is estimated to be 1:7.  Some complications of celiac disease include lymphoma, osteoporosis, anemia,  miscarriages, seizures, vitamin deficiencies, and co-occurrence of other autoimmune diseases. The only treatment  is a gluten-free diet, so that recurrence of symptoms and complications may occur after minor dietary indiscretions.  Identifying the underlying genetic causes of celiac disease may allow us to identify susceptible individuals, as well  as advance new ways to prevent the disease and to treat it once it occurs.</p>  <p>Several genome-wide linkage studies and one genome-wide association study of celiac disease have been conducted. Other than  the common locus at HLA, few putative celiac disease loci have been replicated between studies, suggesting that the disease  is heterogeneous and complex.  A portion of the genetic predisposition can be attributed to HLA, but the etiology is likely  due to a number of rare, high penetrant genes (as would be identified in linkage analysis) and to more common, low  penetrant genes (as would be identified in association studies).</p>  <p>The objective of this study is to identify new loci that increase risk to develop celiac disease.  We will capitalize  on existing North American resources, including three large collections of celiac cases and controls (Aim 1) and an  independent set of celiac cases and their families (Aim 3).  We propose a comprehensive multi-stage approach, with  the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct a genome-wide association (GWA) study of single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs). The GWA will include1900 disease cases and 3400 matched  controls, genotyped using the Illumina Human 610-quad chip.  Statistical analyses will be performed to test  for associations with celiac disease. In Aim 2, we will conduct a combined analysis of our GWA dataset from  Aim 1 and a previous GWA dataset to identify additional low-penetrance loci. In Aim 3, we will attempt to  replicate significant findings from the GWA study in two independent sample sets. At the conclusion of this  study, we expect to have validated a number of SNPs and CNPs from regions in the genome that alter the risk of  developing celiac disease. These SNPs may prove useful at both the clinical and research level. The data from  the study will be shared with the scientific community.</p>	Celiac Disease;Dermatitis Herpetiformis	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000274.v1.p1

The uniqueness of NBFCs is that the data of the cohorts were obtained   from early fetal life (including maternal health during pregnancy) to adulthood. The NFBC1966 includes 12,058 live births   to mothers in the two northern-most provinces of Finland. Two decades later, a second cohort of 9432 births was   obtained (NFBC1986). In NFBC1966 pregnancies were followed prospectively from the first antenatal contact (10-16th week).   After birth, the offspring were examined and then again underwent clinical evaluation at ages 1y, 7y, 14-16y and 31y.   At each visit, a wide range of phenotypic, lifestyle and demographic data were gathered by questionnaires and clinical   examinations. For the most part, NFBC1986 has undergone similar evaluations to NFBC1966. Linkage to national registries   includes hospitalization, deaths, education, medication, pensions, and provides up-to-date demographic and clinical   information for members of both cohorts. DNA samples were obtained from 5,923 subjects from NFBC1966 and 6688 subjects   from NFBC1986. Data coverage, 96% of all births in 1966 and 99% in 1986, is highly representative for the whole   population. The NFBC program comprises more than 20 different projects coordinated by the Center of Lifecourse   Disease studies in Northern Finland (COLD) at Oulu University. The prospective data collected from the NFBCs   form a unique resource, allowing the study of disease emergence, and of the importance of genetic, biological,   social and behavioral risk factors.</p>   <p>The genome-wide association (GWA) study sponsored through the STAMPEED program of NHLBI employed genomic DNA   samples previously collected by the NFBC1966 study and stored in the DNA repository of the National Institute   for Health and Welfare, Finland. This NHLBI sponsored RO1 project aimed to identify genetic variants contributing   to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In addition to de-identified genome wide genotypic data, a   selected list of phenotypic data related to CVD including weight, height, BMI, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol,   triglyceride, glucose, insulin and fasting status, are also available in dbGaP.

These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from    diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied.  These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease,    contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention    and treatments to specific populations.  This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects.     GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers -    BroadGO and SeattleGO.</p>   <p>In the Grand Opportunities Exome Sequencing Program Early MI Project (GO ESP - EOMI), we are sequencing cases with  extremely early-onset MI drawn from 8 cohorts.

The study was begun in 1990   with the initial aims of quantifying the familial aggregation of sleep apnea.  NIH renewals provided expansion of the   original cohort (including increased minority recruitment) and longitudinal follow-up, with the last exam occurring   in February 2006. Index probands (n=275) were recruited from 3 area hospital sleep labs if they had a confirmed   diagnosis of sleep apnea and at least 2 first-degree relatives available to be studied.  In the first 5 years of   the study, neighborhood control probands (n=87) with at least 2 living relatives available for study were selected   at random from a list provided by the index family and also studied. All available first degree relatives and spouses   of the case and control probands also were recruited. Second-degree relatives, including half-sibs, aunts, uncles and   grandparents, were also included if they lived near the first degree relatives (cases or controls), or if the family   had been found to have two or more relatives with sleep apnea.  Blood was sampled and DNA isolated for participants   seen in the last two exam cycles (n=1447). The sample, which is enriched with individuals with sleep apnea, also   contains a high prevalence of individuals with sleep apnea-related traits, including: obesity, impaired glucose   tolerance, and HTN.</p>   <p>Phenotyping data have been collected over 4 exam cycles, each occurring ~every 4 years. The last three exams   targeted all subjects who had been studied at earlier exams, as well as new minority families and family members   of previously studied probands who had been unavailable at prior exams. Data from one, two, three and four visits   are available for 412, 630, 329 and 67, participants, respectively.  In the first 3 exams, participants underwent   overnight in-home sleep studies, allowing determination of the number and duration of hypopneas and apneas, sleep   period, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels; anthropometry (weight, height, and waist, hip, and neck circumferences);   resting blood pressure; spirometry; standardized questionnaire evaluation of symptoms, medications, sleep patterns,   quality of life, daytime sleepiness measures and health history; venipuncture and measurement of total and HDL   cholesterol. The 4th exam (2001-2006) was designed to collect more detailed measurements of sleep, metabolic and   CVD phenotypes and included measurement of state-of-the-art polysomnography, with both collection of blood and   measurement of blood pressure before and after sleep, and anthropometry, upper airway assessments, spirometry,   exhaled nitric oxide, and ECG performed the morning after the sleep study.</p>   <p>Data have been collected by trained research assistants or GCRC nurses following written Manuals of Procedures   who were certified following standard approaches for each study procedure. Ongoing data quality, with assessment of   within or between individual drift, has been monitored on an ongoing basis, using statistical techniques as well as   regular re-certification procedures. Between and within scorer reliabilities for key sleep apnea indices have been   excellent, with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) exceeding 0.92 for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Sleep staging, assessed with   epoch specific comparisons, also demonstrate excellent reliability for stage identification (kappas&gt;0.82). There has   been no evidence of significant time trends-between or within scorers- for the AHI variables. We also have evaluated   the night-to-night variability of the AHI and other sleep variables in 91 subjects, with each measurement made 1-3   months apart. There is high night to night consistency for the AHI (ICC: 0.80), the arousal index (0.76), and   the % sleep time in slow-wave sleep (0.73). We have demonstrated the comparability of the apnea estimates (AHI)   determined from limited channel studies obtained at in-home settings with in full in-laboratory polysomnography.   In addition to our published validation study, we more recently compared the AHI in 169 Cleveland Family Study   participants undergoing both assessments (in-home and in-laboratory) within one week apart. These showed excellent   levels of agreement (ICC=0.83), demonstrating the feasibility of examining data from either in-home or in-laboratory   studies for apnea phenotyping. Data collected in the GCRC were obtained, when possible, with comparable, if not   identical techniques, as were the same measures collected at prior exams performed in the participants&#39; homes. To   address the comparability of data collected over different exams, we calculated the crude age-adjusted   correlations ~3 year within individual correlations between measures made in the most recent GCRC exam with   measures made in a prior exam and demonstrated excellent levels of agreement for BMI (r=.91); waist   circumference (0.91);  FVC (0.88); and FEV1 (0.86). As expected due to higher biological and measurement   variability, 149 somewhat lower 3-year correlations were demonstrated for SBP (0.56); Diastolic BP (0.48); AHI (0.62);   and nocturnal oxygen desaturation (0.60).</p>   <p><b>NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource.</b> The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI.

Participants were enrolled from each of 4 recruitment pools: random, 17%; volunteer, 30%; currently enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, 31% and secondary family members, 22%. Recruitment was limited to non-institutionalized adult African Americans 35-84 years old, except in the family cohort where those 21 to 34 years of age were eligible. The final cohort of 5,301 participants includes 6.59% of all African American Jackson MSA residents aged 35-84 (N-76,426, US Census 2000). Major components of each exam include medical history, physical examination, blood/urine analytes and interview questions on areas such as: physical activity; stress, coping and spirituality; racism and discrimination; socioeconomic position; and access to health care. At 12-month intervals after the baseline clinic visit (Exam 1), participants are contacted by telephone to: update information; confirm vital statistics; document interim medical events, hospitalizations, and functional status; and obtain additional sociocultural information. Questions about medical events, symptoms of cardiovascular disease and functional status are repeated annually. Ongoing cohort surveillance includes abstraction of medical records and death certificates for relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and adjudication of nonfatal events and deaths.</p> <p><b>The JHS Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP sub-studies.</b> To view genotypes, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these sub-studies, please click on the following sub-studies below or in the "Sub-studies" box located on the right hand side of this top-level study page <a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000286">phs000286</a> JHS Cohort. <ul> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000402">phs000402</a> HeartGO_JHS</li> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000498">phs000498</a> JHS_AllelicSpectrum_Seq</li> <li><a href="./study.cgi?study_id=phs000499">phs000499</a> JHS_CARe</li> </ul> </p>	Cardiovascular Diseases;Coronary Artery Disease;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Obesity;Hypertension;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Stroke;Heart Failure;Peripheral Vascular Diseases;Arrhythmias, Cardiac	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000286.v4.p1

The objectives of the Cardiovascular Health Study are to: 1) quantify associations of conventional and hypothesized risk factors with CHD and stroke; 2) assess the associations of non-invasive measures of subclinical disease with the incidence of CHD and stroke; 3) quantify the associations of risk factors with subclinical disease; 4) characterize the natural history of CHD and stroke, and identify factors associated with clinical course; and 5) describe the prevalence and distributions of risk factors, non-invasive measures of subclinical disease, and clinical CHD and stroke.</p> <p><b>Background</b></p> <p>The study originated in 1988 from the recommendations of an NHLBI workshop on the management of CHD in the elderly. This is the most extensive study undertaken by the NHLBI to study CVD exclusively in an elderly population. Initially funded for six years, it was renewed for a second six year period in 1994 and recently was renewed with limited support for the Coordinating Center, the Laboratory and the Steering Committee. Grant funding from several sources has supported an additional clinic visit in 2005-2006 and continued morbidity and mortality follow-up.</p> <p><b>Subjects</b></p> <p>The 5,888 study participants were recruited from four U.S. communities and have undergone extensive clinic examinations for evaluation of markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease. The original cohort totaled 5,201 participants. A new cohort was recruited in 1992. The 687 participants in the new cohort are predominately African-American and were recruited at three of the four field centers.</p> <p><b>Design</b></p> <p>The 2,962 women and 2,239 men were examined yearly from 1989 through 1999. The added minority cohort of 256 men and 431 women was examined from 1992 to 1999. Examination components have included medical history questionnaires, measurement of ankle-brachial index, abdominal and carotid ultrasound studies, echocardiograms, ambulatory electrocardiograms, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, spirometry and retinal photographs over the past decade. The most extensive evaluations were at study entry (baseline) and again in 1992-1993 to assess change in subclinical disease measures. CHS has undertaken extensive follow-up for ascertainment of cardiovascular events including incident claudication, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke and death.</p> <p><b>Genetic Research</b></p> <p>The Cardiovascular Health Study has expanded its research mission into the study of genetic factors underlying CVD and other disorders using DNA that was collected from blood samples from most participants. Subsets of CHS participants have been genotyped in large-scale genotyping projects, including thousands of SNP genotypes for candidate gene regions as part of the NHLBI Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) and genome-wide genotyping as part of the NHLBI SNP Typing for Association with Multiple Phenotypes from Existing Epidemiologic Data (STAMPEED). Whole exome sequencing of an overlapping subset of CHS participants was performed through the NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP).</p> <p>The Cardiovascular Health Study Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP substudies.

The majority of these subjects are independent from the current study, but there is a small amount of overlap between the two samples (n=29 subjects) for quality control purposes. It should be noted that the case definition in the SAGE study is DSM-IV alcohol dependence. The case definition in the current study is nicotine dependence by a current score of 4 or greater on the Fagerstr&#246;m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND).</p> <p>The overall goal of this project is to identify and characterize genetic variants that contribute to the development of nicotine dependence, related smoking behaviors, and smoking cessation. The COGEND sample includes unrelated cases and controls for a genetic association study of nicotine dependence. Cases are defined by a commonly used definition of nicotine dependence, a current score of 4 or more (maximum score of 10) on the Fagerstr&#246;m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Control status is defined as an individual who smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime, yet never became dependent (lifetime FTND=0). By selecting controls who smoked, those genetic effects that are specific to nicotine dependence can be examined.</p> <p>The UW-TTURC sample includes nicotine dependent smokers from three smoking cessation studies. Subjects had to smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day (confirmed smoking by an alveolar carbon monoxide (CO) level greater than 9) and report being motivated to quit smoking. Participants were excluded based on evidence of psychosis history, clinically significant depression symptoms, other severe mental illness, or contraindications to smoking cessation medications.</p> <p><b><u>COGEND</u></b>: COGEND was initiated in 2001 as a three-part program project grant funded through the National Cancer Institute (NCI; PI: Laura Bierut). The three projects included a study of the familial transmission of nicotine dependence, a genetic study of nicotine dependence, and a study of the relationship of nicotine dependence with nicotine metabolism. The primary goal is to detect, localize, and characterize genes that predispose or protect an individual with respect to heavy tobacco consumption, nicotine dependence, and related phenotypes and to integrate these findings with the family transmission and nicotine metabolism findings. The primary design is a community based case-control family study. Nicotine dependent cases and non-dependent, smoking controls were identified and recruited from Detroit and St. Louis. In addition, one sibling for each case and control subject was recruited in a subset of the sample. More than 54,000 subjects aged 25-44 years were screened by telephone; more than 3,100 subjects were personally interviewed; and more than 2,900 subjects donated blood samples for genetic studies.</p> <p><b><u>UW-TTURC</u></b>: The UW-TTURC was initiated in 2001 as a study of nicotine dependence and smoking cessation treatment. The second round of UW-TTURC was initiated in 2005 as a study of efficacy of smoking cessation and long term outcomes. Nicotine dependent smokers seeking cessation treatment were identified and recruited from Madison and Milwaukee, WI. Over 9,000 adult smokers were screened by telephone; 2,575 individuals were enrolled and randomized to treatment conditions that involved use of different smoking cessation medications. Participants from the UW-TTURC smoking cessation clinical trials had the option of participating in a genetic substudy, and approximately 2,000 donated blood samples for genetic studies. The goal of the genetic studies of smokers seeking cessation treatment is to detect, localize, and characterize genes that predispose or protect an individual with respect to heavy tobacco consumption, nicotine dependence, and related phenotypes including cessation, withdrawal, and relapse.</p> <p>Both studies (COGEND and UW-TTURC) include measures of basic socio-demographic variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, and educational attainment. Information on nicotine dependence, as assessed by the Fagerstr&#246;m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) is available for all subjects. In addition, participants also completed the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS; Shiffman et al., 2004) and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM-68; Piper et al, 2004). Coding for both individual variables and indices has been standardized across studies.

Epidemiological findings have repeatedly and unequivocally determined that heritable variation  in DNA plays a substantial role in the etiology of autism and autism spectrum disorders, yet traditional efforts to identify  the genetic basis of this striking heritability have met with very limited success to date and have therefore provided  limited insight into disease biology. We propose here an unprecedented partnership between expert large-scale sequencing  centers (at the Baylor College of Medicine and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard) and a collaborative network of  research labs focused on the genetics of autism (brought together by the Autism Genome Project and the Autism Consortium).  These groups will work together to utilize dramatic new advances in DNA sequencing technology to reveal the genetic architecture  of autism, first through a comprehensive examination of the exonic sequence of all genes (that is, the coding part of the genome).  The goal is to conclusively identify which genes harbor individual or collections of rare DNA variants that predispose to  autism, and thus translate the abstract heritability into solid biological clues about disease pathogenesis that can be  studied molecularly and approached therapeutically. These efforts and their follow-up, which will be performed on thousands  of autism families collected by the autism research groups and being provided with phenotype data to NIMH repositories,  will form the cornerstone of autism genetic research going forward.  </p>	Autistic Disorder	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000298.v1.p1

Cases and controls were selected  from the tamoxifen arm in the P-1 and from the tamixifen and raloxifene arms in the P-2 trial. For the P-1 trial,  cases and controls were required to be 50 years of age or older at time of entry.  Cases were females who  experienced an invasive breast cancer or DCIS on P-1 or P-2.

These studies will continue to have a dramatic impact on our understanding of the contribution of common genetic variation on inter-individual susceptibility to this common cancer. Important questions that will remain unanswered, however, are whether all common risk alleles for prostate cancer will be revealed in studies limited to populations of European ancestry. A comprehensive examination of common genetic variation in men of Japanese, Latino, and African ancestry will be required to understand population differences in disease risk and to reveal the full spectrum of causal alleles that exist in these populations. Further, genetic and environmental diversity is likely to contribute to ethnic heterogeneity of genetic effects. Elucidating gene x gene and gene x environment interactions is also likely to provide knowledge that may be critical for understanding the contribution of genetic susceptibility to racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer incidence and for translating the findings from GWA studies into interventions.</p> <p>In this study we plan to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of prostate cancer in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study. We propose the following hypotheses: (a) that inherited DNA variation influences risk of prostate cancer; (b) that many of the causal alleles will be outside known "candidate genes" requiring an agnostic, comprehensive search; and (c) that performing this search in a multi-ethnic cohort is more powerful than a study limited to a single population to reveal the full range of causal alleles relevant to the U.S. population.</p> <p>The version 1 release of this dataset will include genotype data for the Japanese and Latino populations in the study.

Vision loss from POAG is a condition of public health significance. Current evidence suggests that POAG is a polygenetic disease modified by environmental influences. Despite the fact that a positive family history of disease is an important risk factor for POAG, conventional linkage and candidate gene approaches have revealed less than 5% of the genetic component of the disease. Furthermore, there is no consensus on environment risk factors for POAG. Elevated IOP is the only modifiable risk factor for POAG; yet, lowering IOP slows, but does not halt the disease process.</p> <p><b>Study Objectives:</b> The overall goal of our research is to elucidate the pathogenesis of POAG so that cost-effective disease detection and primary prevention strategies can be implemented. The primary aim of the <b>Glau</b>coma <b>G</b>ene <b>En</b>vironment Initiative (GLAUGEN), funded by the Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), is to discover genetic loci associated with POAG. The secondary aim of GLAUGEN, funded by NHGRI and the National Eye Institute, is to discover gene environment interactions in POAG.</p> <p><b>Methods and study populations:</b> For this study, we have assembled cases and controls from three studies: the Nurses&#39; Health Study (<b>NHS</b>), the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (<b>HPFS</b>) and the Genetic Etiologies of POAG (<b>GEP</b>) project based at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI). This case-control group includes 1057 unrelated cases and 1272 controls. Members of the NHS and HPFS also have repeated environmental exposure data collected prior to a diagnosis of POAG.</p> <p>NHS - The Nurses Health Study started in 1976 under the direction of Dr. Frank E. Speizer. With funding from the NIH, registered nurses from 11 US states were invited to complete a detailed questionnaire regarding lifestyle and health biennially. Initially, 121,000 women responded to the baseline questionnaire. Currently, Dr. Susan Hankinson serves as the program director for the NHS.</p> <p>HPFS - The Health Professionals Follow-up Study began in 1986 under the direction of Drs. Walter Willett and Meir Stampfer. Under the auspices of the NIH, they enlisted 51,529 male health professionals from throughout the US to complete similarly designed biennial questionnaires.</p> <p>Beginning in 1990, questions regarding ocular health were added to biennial questionaires completed by health professionals participating in the NHS and HPFS. This allowed us to formulate (PI: S. Hankinson; NEI) and maintain (PI: L. Pasquale; NEI) a cohort at risk for POAG derived from the respective general cohorts who were under ophthalmic care. We then developed a definition of POAG that allowed us to identify cases from a population that was geographically dispersed. The centerpiece of this definition is the presence of reproducible visual field loss consistent with nerve fiber layer (NFL) dropout (the NFL contains the axons that comprise the optic nerve) on reliable tests. Reproducible visual field loss occurred in the context of anterior segment findings that did not suggest a secondary cause of elevated IOP and posterior segment findings that did not suggest a secondary cause of visual field loss. We selected controls from the cohort at risk for POAG on the basis of age, gender and time period when cases were identified.</p> <p>GEP - The Genetic Etiologies of POAG was initiated in 1996 with funding from the National Eye Institute under the direction of Dr. Janey Wiggs. The purpose of this work was to discover novel genetic loci associated with POAG. In the GEP, cases were derived predominantly from the Glaucoma Service at MEEI. The majority of cases had an examination by a glaucoma specialist and met the definition for POAG used in NHS and HPFS. Cases with only one reliable visual field consistent with NFL dropout were included if there was a cup-disc ratio of 0.7 or more. The majority of controls were patients who presented to the MEEI comprehensive ophthalmology service for routine eye examination or from spouses of MEEI patients with secondary forms of glaucoma. Other controls were identified from regional glaucoma screenings held throughout Massachusetts.

To    date little is known about the presence of non-ETS fusion events in prostate cancer. We employed next-generation transcriptome    sequencing (RNA-Seq) in order to explore the whole transcriptome of 25 human prostate cancer samples for the presence of chimeric    fusion transcripts. We generated more than 1 billion sequence reads and used a novel computational approach (FusionSeq) in order    to identify novel gene fusion candidates with high confidence. In total, we discovered and characterized seven new cancer-specific    gene fusions, two involving the ETS genes <i>ETV1</i> and <i>ERG</i>, and five involving non-ETS genes such as <i>CDKN1A</i> (p21), <i>CD9</i> and    <i>IKBKB</i> (IKK-beta), genes known to exhibit key biological roles in cellular homeostasis or assumed to be critical in    tumorigenesis of other tumor entities, as well as the oncogene PIGU and the tumor suppressor gene <i>RSRC2</i>. The novel gene fusions are    found to be of low frequency but interestingly, the non-ETS fusions were all present in prostate cancer harboring the <i>TMPRSS2-ERG</i>   gene fusion.

The project will generate draft genome sequences for 1,000 individuals using whole genome shotgun sequencing. The draft sequences will allow investigators to evaluate the contribution of common (frequency &gt;5.0%) and rare (frequency 0.5 - 5.0%) single nucleotide polymorphisms, short insertions and deletions, large copy number polymorphisms and other structural variants to blood levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and triglycerides (TG), all of which are key risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and to the 5 domains of personality as assessed by NEO-PI-R questionnaire. The two traits represent different ends of the spectrum of medically interesting complex traits. Blood lipid levels are risk factor for cardiovascular disease for which genetic studies have been very successful. In contrast, personality traits and other behavioral phenotypes represent a set of phenotypes that have proven more challenging to dissect using standard genetic tools. In both cases, we expect whole genome sequencing to improve our understanding of the underlying biology.</p> <p>The isolated Sardinian population is ideal for this type of study for several reasons, and in particular because: (i) the bottleneck that occurred after colonization of the island attenuated natural selection against alleles with phenotypic consequences, increasing the odds that functional alleles will reach modest frequencies (0.5 - 5.0%) and will be detected in the present study and (ii) sharing of long haplotype stretches surrounding rare variants will facilitate imputation based analyses of shotgun sequence data, which improve the accuracy of individual genotype calls and thus increase power.</p> <p>This research helps advance NIH&#39;s mission by furthering our understanding of the genetic factors contributing to blood lipid levels and coronary heart disease and to personality, behavior and mental health. In addition, these data should facilitate development of analysis tools and strategies that can be used to study the genomes of hundreds to thousands of individuals and further our understanding of the genetics and biology of many different traits and conditions.</p>	Cardiovascular Diseases;Lipoproteins;Personality;Behavior;Mental Health	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000313.v3.p2

While the orthopedic care of these children has improved, long-term problems persist and the health care costs are significant. Studies suggest that clubfoot is a complex disorder with segregation analyses and family studies indicating that genetic factors play an important etiologic role in the development of clubfoot. Only one environmental factor, maternal smoking during pregnancy, has been implicated. We postulate that a small number of genes account for a substantial fraction of clubfoot and that these genes can be identified in a defined population. The challenge now is to identify the genetic loci and, later, the effect of environmental exposures. To accomplish this task, it is important to have a well-defined population and the methodology to detect linkage with and without association. Towards these goals, we have identified and characterized multiplex clubfoot families, including two large clubfoot families, a resource which is among the largest ITEV populations in existence. We will perform a high-density SNP genome scan (GWAS) on our clubfoot dataset to identify chromosomal regions that may harbor clubfoot genes with subsequent interrogation of these regions and candidate genes. We are in a position with our unique clubfoot population and with the methodology in place to undertake this study. The study phases are: 1) continued ascertainment of multiplex and simplex families and 2) GWAS and characterization of identified chromosomal regions and candidate genes. The results of this study will provide data essential to the identification of the gene(s) contributing to the clubfoot phenotype. Identification of high-risk genotypes can lead to the development of prevention programs in selected populations and may suggest gene-based prevention strategies.</p>	Clubfoot	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000314.v1.p1

GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.</p> <p>The Siblings with Ischemic Stroke Study (SWISS) is an affected sibpair (ASP) study of patients and their brothers/sisters who have had similar strokes. The study was conducted to determine the genes that contribute to an individual&#39;s risk of developing an ischemic stroke (a stroke due to sudden interruption of blood flow to a part of the brain). Over 600 people have participated in SWISS, with the coordination of the recruitment and flow of the samples occurring at the Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, under the direction of James F. Meschia, MD. The University of Virginia (Stephen S. Rich, PhD) served as the analytic site for the genetic data. Participants were excluded from SWISS if they had stroke following an invasive cerebrovascular or cardiovascular procedure, if their stroke occurred shortly following an aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage, if the stroke occurred in the setting of a mechanical aortic or mitral valve, if the patient had definite CNS vasculitis or if the patient had a Mendelian mitochondrial stroke disorder, including CADASIL, MELAS, Fabry disease, sickle cell anemia or homocysteinemia.</p> <p>For the NHLBI ESP, the youngest 51 ASPs (102 individuals) from SWISS were selected to undergo exome sequencing. These ASPs were selected from among all SWISS participants, excluding those pedigrees with individuals who had TOAST subtypes of stroke of other etiology or of stroke with undetermined etiology. In addition, the affected siblings were required to have the same TOAST subtype (both small vessel (lacunar) or both large vessel (atherosclerotic)). Of those selected, 98 samples passed initial quality control metrics, and 94 completed exome sequencing and were deposited in dbGaP.</p> <p>An additional set of 590 samples from the SWISS collection has been genotyped on the ExomeChip that contained a subset of rare/infrequent variants identified by exome sequencing. These samples include 495 affected individuals (from multiple affected family members) as well as 95 unaffected family members. These genetic and phenotypic data also will reside in dbGaP.</p>	Stroke	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000327.v1.p1

The molecular pathogenesis  of DLBCL is associated with multiple genetic lesions that in part distinctly segregate with individual phenotypic subtypes, suggesting  the involvement of distinct oncogenic pathways. However, the lesions identified so far likely represent only a fraction of those  necessary for malignant transformation. In order to characterize the entire set of structural alterations present in the DLBCL  genome, we have integrated next generation whole exome sequencing analysis of 7 DLBCL cases and genome-wide high-density SNP  array analysis of 72 DLBCL cases. We report here that FL and DLBCL harbor frequent structural alterations inactivating CREBBP,  and more rarely, EP300, two highly related histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as transcriptional  co-activators in multiple signaling pathways. Overall, ~37% of DLBCL and 36% of FL cases display genomic deletions and/or  somatic point mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions commonly affect a  single allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in  the acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 onco-protein and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor. These results  identify CREBBP/EP300 mutations as a major pathogenetic mechanism shared by common forms of B-NHL, and have direct  implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.</p>	Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000328.v1.p1

The broad goals of the LungGO/ESP-GO falls into two general categories: (i) discovery of all variants (i.e., common and rare) in all protein-coding regions of the human genome (i.e., the exome) conferring risk to complex pulmonary diseases including COPD, in a subset of the LHS cohort. The Johns Hopkins University LHS cohort offers a unique opportunity to elucidate genetic variants that cause COPD.</p> <p>The Lung Health Study I was a randomized multicenter clinical trial with 5887 participants carried out from October 1986 to April 1994, designed to test the effectiveness of smoking cessation and bronchodilator administration in smokers aged 35 to 60 with mild lung function impairment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: <ul> <li>usual care, who received no intervention</li> <li>smoking intervention with the inhaled bronchodilator ipratroprium bromide</li> <li>smoking intervention with an inhaled placebo.</li> </ul> The effect of intervention was evaluated by the rate of decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). </p> <p>For the GWAS, only the subset of European American LHS participants for whom lung function data from three time points or more are available. Thus, the GWAS represents 73% of the 5,887 volunteers who participated in the LHS study. Importantly, LHS subjects included had similar demographics (including age, gender and BMI) and rates of lung function decline (mean annual change in FEV1% predicted: -0.96 %/yr vs. -0.99 %/yr, p=0.57) compared with those not included in the GWAS, reflecting little selection bias for our primary outcome.

These disorders impact at least 1:5000 live births, and are characterized by multi-organ system involvement. They are characterized by remarkable locus heterogeneity, with mutations in the mtDNA as well as in over 77 nuclear genes identified to date. It is estimated that additional genes may be mutated in these disorders. </p> <p>To discover the genetic causes of mitochondrial OXPHOS diseases, we performed targeted, deep sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and the coding exons of over 1000 nuclear genes encoding the mitochondrial proteome.

To address this challenge, we have developed CREST, an algorithm that uses sequencing reads with partial alignments to the reference human genome (so-called soft-clipped reads) to directly map the breakpoints of somatic structural variations. We applied CREST to paired tumor/normal whole genome sequencing data from five cases of T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). A total of 110 somatic structural variants were identified, &gt;80% of which were validated by genomic PCR and Sanger sequencing. The validated structural variants included 31 inter-chromosomal translocations, 19 intra-chromosomal translocations, one inversion, 22 deletions and 16 insertions. A comparison of the results generated with CREST to those obtained using the traditional paired-end discordant mapping methods demonstrate CREST to have a much higher sensitivity and specificity. In addition, application of CREST to publicly available whole-genome sequencing data from the human melanoma cancer cell line COLO-829 demonstrated the identification of 50 novel structural variations not detected using the standard methods, 20 of which were selected for validation with a 90% success rate. These data demonstrate that direct mapping of soft-clipped reads offers an improved method for detecting structural variants at the nucleotide level of resolution.</p> <p><b>T-ALL</b></p> <p>Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ETP ALL) is an aggressive malignancy of unknown genetic basis. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 12 ETP ALL cases and assessed the frequency of the identified somatic mutations in 94 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases. ETP ALL was characterized by activating mutations in genes regulating cytokine receptor and RAS signalling (67% of cases; <i>NRAS</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>FLT3</i>, <i>IL7R</i>, <i>JAK3</i>, <i>JAK1</i>, <i>SH2B3</i> and <i>BRAF</i>), inactivating lesions disrupting haematopoietic development (58%; <i>GATA3</i>, <i>ETV6</i>, <i>RUNX1</i>, <i>IKZF1</i> and <i>EP300</i>) and histone-modifying genes (48%; <i>EZH2</i>, <i>EED</i>, <i>SUZ12</i>, <i>SETD2</i> and <i>EP300</i>). We also identified new targets of recurrent mutation including <i>DNM2</i>, <i>ECT2L</i> and <i>RELN</i>. The mutational spectrum is similar to myeloid tumours, and moreover, the global transcriptional profile of ETP ALL was similar to that of normal and myeloid leukaemia haematopoietic stem cells.

Here we report an integrative genomic analysis that identifies multiple subtypes of hypodiploid ALL characterized by variation in the degree of aneuploidy, distinct submicroscopic deletions and sequence mutations and gene expression profile. Near haploid ALL cases (24-31 chromosomes) have a high frequency of alterations of genes regulating Ras pathway and cytokine receptor signaling (66.2%; <i>NF1</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>PTPN11</i>, <i>FLT3</i>, and <i>PAG1</i>), <i>IKZF3</i> (encoding the lymphoid transcription factor AIOLOS), and a histone gene cluster at 6p22. Low hypodiploid cases (32-39 chromosomes) are enriched for <i>IKZF2</i> (HELIOS) and <i>RB1</i> alterations, but have a low frequency of Ras/signaling alterations. A striking finding was exclusivity of Ras/signaling and <i>IKZF2/3</i> alterations, and biochemical evidence of Ras pathway activation in both near haploid and low hypodiploid ALL. Together, these findings provide critical new insights into the genetic basis of hypodiploid ALL, and indicate that therapeutic targeting of the Ras pathway should be pursued in this disease.</p>	Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000341.v1.p1

All retinoblastomas are believed to initiate with biallelic inactivation of the RB1 gene. To identify subsequent genetic lesions in retinoblastoma, we performed whole genome sequencing of tumor and normal DNA of 4 children with retinoblastoma and one matched orthotopic xenograft. Both alleles of RB1 were inactivated in the tumor samples. 3 of the patients had sporadic retinoblastoma and one patient had inherited retinoblastoma. Overall, there were few single nucleotide changes in coding regions of the genome and some of the tumors had few chromosomal lesions. There were very few new genetic lesions in the xenograft compared to the primary tumor. These data suggest that the genome in retinoblastoma is more stable than previously believed and there are relatively few recurrent genetic lesions in known cancer pathways other than the RB1 pathway.</p>	Retinoblastoma	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000352.v1.p1
phs000353.v1.p1	GENEVA Study of Preterm Delivery (African-American)	3478	Case-Control	HumanOmni1_Quad_v1-0_B	GWAS	African American	\N	\N	\N	<p>Preterm delivery resulting in the birth of a premature infant is a complex problem with a devastating impact on individuals, families and society. The prevalence of preterm birth has increased steadily in developed countries over the last 20 years and more than three million children die of preterm birth worldwide each year. Despite the importance of the problem and its disproportionate occurrence in poor and minority populations, the underlying causes have been difficult to identify. Spontaneous preterm labor has as its suspected triggers infection, stress, poor nutrition and inherited factors. The single best predictor for preterm delivery is a previous preterm birth. Studies of twins and of recurrences within families provide evidence that genetic factors underlie a substantive component of the risk for prematurity. One major challenge in studying genetic factors in prematurity is that the risk case is not truly established. The genetic risk could reside either in the mother and her uterus or in the infant/placenta. Identification of genetic factors in the mother and/or infant could provide insights into identifying relevant environmental covariates that may be more amenable to rapid interventions but difficult to find using standard epidemiology alone. A comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) is the ideal way to identify those genes that would not be suspected based on our current understanding of the biology of parturition. We are using 2200 African American samples with term or preterm labor. A subset of these (~800) are infant samples recruited by the Neonatal Research Network as part of a study on cytokines and infection in extremely low birth weight infants (Schelonka RL, et al., 2011. PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21145756" target="_blank">21145756</a>). Therefore, this group consists of infants &lt;1,000 grams with clinical outcome data for the infant allowing study of the genetic contributors for not only preterm birth but also the complications that often accompany preterm birth. The result will enable a better understanding of the biology of parturition and suggest environmental modifications that can prolong gestations to improve neonatal and adult outcomes.</p> <p>This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, <a href="http://www.genevastudy.org" target="_blank">http://www.genevastudy.org</a>) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to preterm birth through large-scale genome-wide association studies of African-American cases and controls from multiple sites in the United States. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.</p>	Premature Birth	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000353.v1.p1

By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here      that the typical CLL coding genome contains less than 20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly      non-silent mutations and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously      known to be altered in CLL. While most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort,      mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during      disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0%) as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8%). Consistent with the      association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged      as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome      and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.</p>	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000364.v1.p1

Although a genetic etiology has     been suspected for patients with abnormally low CD4+ T cells in the absence of HIV infection or any known causes of lymphopenia,     no genetic mutation has been described to date for any case of primary CD4 lymphopenia. In this study, we characterized a     non-consanguineous family with two non-HIV infected boys exhibiting an inverted CD4 to CD8 T cell ratio and a history of     recurrent chronic viral infections since birth. Consistent with a decreased thymic output of CD4+ T cells, the percentage     of CD31+ cells in the CD4+ naive population of these patients was decreased. In addition, the activation of T cells was     significantly impaired in the patient upon TCR stimulation. Given the mother&#39;s T cells show completely skewed X chromosome     inactivation, we suspected that the nature of this disease is X-linked. We performed X-chromosome exon-capture targeted     single-end Solexa sequencing on two brothers and the mother and found a 10 base pair deletion at an intron-exon junction     of Magnesium Transporter 1 (MAGT1), a Mg<sup>2+</sup> specific transporter. We confirmed that this deletion leads to altered splicing,     frameshift, early termination of the mRNA, and deficient protein expression in the lymphocytes of the two patients.     Moreover, knockdown of this transporter in T cells isolated from healthy donors can recapitulate the observed T cell     activation defect while its ectopic expression in the patients&#39; lymphocytes can restore T cell stimulation. Our discovery     highlights the significance of this transporter to T cell function.</p>	\N	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000365.v1.p1

Altogether,      the results suggest that large-scale exome sequencing may illuminate fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms with important      therapeutic implications.</p>	Head and Neck Neoplasms	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000370.v1.p1

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, in which intestinal anatomy is altered, dramatically ameliorates and/or eliminates Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in 50-80% of patients within hours to days following surgery, well before significant weight loss, in contrast to other types of bariatric surgeries, such as gastric banding, that attenuate insulin resistance as a result of substantial weight loss that occurs over months to years. The molecular mechanism by which RYGB exerts this clinical phenomenon is not known. The goal of this project was to conduct a genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with amelioration in T2D defined by medication independence. Identifying genetic variants that influence the dramatic resolution of T2D from RYGB may identify novel targets for pharmacological T2D therapies and/or identify patients in whom RYGB may not be effective.</p>	Type 2 Diabetes;Obesity;Bariatric Surgery	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000380.v1.p1

Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were a primary care patient of a Geisinger Clinic     physician and were scheduled for a non-emergent clinic visit.  All participants provided written informed consent and     HIPAA authorization.  Consenting patient agreed to provide blood samples for broad biomedical research use, and permission     to access data in their Geisinger electronic medical record for research.  The enrollment rate was 90% of patients approached.     The demographics of the cohort approximate those of the Geisinger Clinic outpatient population.  Research blood samples were     collected during an outpatient clinical phlebotomy encounter.  Research blood samples are coded and stored in a central biorepository.     Samples are linkable to clinical data in a de-identified manner for research via an IRB-approved data broker process.  For genomic     analysis, DNA is extracted from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood.  For the initial eMERGE Geisinger eGenomic Medicine (GeM)     genotyping project, a subset of 1,232 unique samples were genotyped using Illumina HumanOmniExpress-12 v1.0 arrays, and used     as population controls for other Geisinger Clinic case cohorts, including abdominal aortic aneurysm and gastric bypass surgery cases.     These samples were selected from a larger subset of approximately 6,000 MyCode DNA samples using a partial matching algorithm     that included age, sex, and body mass index as variables.</p>	\N	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000381.v1.p1

Joubert syndrome is a recessive disease characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. Our currently funded NINDS award entitled "Molecular characterization of Joubert syndrome" seeks to identify new genetic causes through a variety of molecular strategies. Although our previous strategies involved whole genome SNP-scans, followed by candidate gene sequencing to arrive at identification of new JS causes, we have recently moved to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) as a highly efficient methodology that is optimized for recessive disease. In this pilot project, CIDR has sequenced DNA on probands from 20 inbred families with JS spectrum disorders in which known causes have been excluded, that have not previously undergone genome-wide SNP scans. These paired end reads will be subject to our established bioinformatics pipeline including HOMOZGYOSITY, SNP and INDEL callers in our lab to identify potentially deleterious sequence changes (PDSC). This is followed by analysis to include testing each PDSC for segregation in the whole pedigree, for occurrence in a ethnically-matched cohort, as well as a defined patient cohort patients, in order to validate new NDD genes.</p>	COACH syndrome;Cerebellar Ataxias;Developmental Delay Disorders;Joubert syndrome;Leber Congenital Amaurosis;Mental Retardation;Polycystic Kidney, Autosomal Recessive;Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary;Walker-Warburg Syndrome	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000382.v1.p1

Women in the African Diaspora experience a     disproportionate burden of pre-menopausal breast cancer in comparison to all other races for reasons that remain unknown and     understudied. This higher proportion of early-onset breast cancer might suggest a stronger genetic component in these populations.     Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed several genetic loci that confer risk of breast cancer. Because all GWAS     started the discovery stage in women of European ancestry and replicated mainly in women of European ancestry, we propose a novel     approach for a GWAS in indigenous African women to identify alleles associated with breast cancer risk which will then be replicated     in other populations.  This innovative design builds on our current understanding of the etiologic heterogeneity in breast cancer     and the distribution of breast cancer molecular subtypes which differ between women of African ancestry and women of European ancestry.     The major objective of the proposed studies is to get to the "root" causes of breast cancer by identifying breast cancer risk alleles     in a pooled sample of women of African ancestry and to replicate our findings in other populations.</p>     <p>To achieve this objective, we conducted a case control study of breast cancer in women of African ancestry, including Africans     living in Nigeria, African Americans and African Barbadians. We will genotype ~3800 individuals using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-Quad     platform.  We will conduct both standard and novel genetic analyses of the data to map genes associated with breast cancer     susceptibility, verify genotyping and carry out fine-mapping studies in genes or regions showing association with breast cancer risk,     and replicate in other African American and non-African American populations. By pooling unique resources from studies throughout     the African Diaspora, this study has the potential to identify risk alleles in several genes that contribute to increased     breast cancer risk and may have implications for early detection, prognosis and treatment of breast cancer in ALL women.     This should ultimately lead to improved outcomes for those who suffer a disproportionate burden of early-onset breast cancer.</p>	\N	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000383.v1.p1

DNA methylation alterations are ubiquitous in human cancers, as many genes acquire DNA methylation in a cancer-specific manner. DNA methylation at these sites in the genome of cancer cells not only serves as a marker for tumor identification, but together with gene mutation and gene expression data, can also be used to describe subsets of tumors of the same organ source. We have previously shown distinct human colorectal cancer subtypes based on DNA methylation differences. Correlating these DNA methylation differences with clinical co-variates will serve to further understand how these distinct subtypes are generated. We have collected 100 colorectal tumor tissues (for which clinical information is known) and have obtained (unprotected) genome-wide DNA methylation and chromatin modification information for each sample for the purposes of identifying and classifying unique tumor subtypes of colorectal cancers. In addition, we have determined mutations of key genes relevant to colorectal cancer as well as gene expression profiles.

It is the      most prevalent metabolic bone disease and is a major public health problem which may result in devastating morbidity and mortality.      The most powerful, measurable determinant of fracture risk is bone mineral density (BMD). More than 60% of BMD variation is      attributable to genetic factors. There are gender differences in BMD that contribute to a substantially higher fracture risk      among women than men.

CPMC is a community hospital in San Francisco, which has one of the highest volumes for mammography in San Francisco. Between September 2004 and June 2007, &gt;90,000 mammograms were performed at CPMC. The CPMC breast health cohort collects demographic and risk factor data on women receiving mammography through participation in the San Francisco Mammography Registry, as part of the Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (U01CA063740). The SFMR database collects information from all sources, including a questionnaire on demographic and risk factor information, the clinical results of the breast examination, the measures of breast density by Dr. John Shepherd and the women who agreed to donate a blood sample. By merging these various sources of information we have very efficiently developed a large sample of women who have donated blood and have had a measure of mamographic density.</p> <p><i>Blood Collection</i>: Dr. Steve Cummings is leading an effort to collect and archive blood samples from women who are receiving mammography screening. All women who are sent for a screening mammogram at CPMC are considered eligible. Since the cohort began collecting blood samples in July 2004 until June 2007, samples have been collected from over 11,000 women.</p> <p><i>Measurement of Breast Density</i>: Dr. John Shepherd is currently measuring breast density in a large fraction of the cohort using an automated approach with single X-ray absorptiometry. Dr. Shepherd has established a link with the CPMC mammography center that allows him to collect routine digital mammography information. Using the data from the mammogram, Dr. Shepherd and his group have developed the single X-ray absorptiometry (SXA) technique for measuring density which is described in more detail below.</p> <p>The table demonstrates the distribution of demographic variables and some breast cancer risk factors of women who donated blood and had a breast density measurement in the CPMC breast health cohort. Nearly 80% of the participants are Caucasian and most of the women are post-menopausal with a median age of ~52. Since it will be difficult to accrue a large enough sample from each ethnic group, our study will focus only on Caucasian women.</p> <p><b>Table</b>: Demographic variables, reproductive history and family history of breast cancer among 2962 women participating in the CPMC cohort study who contributed blood samples between 1994-1997. <table border="1"> <tr> <th>Variable</th> <th>Median/Percentage</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Age (Median/IQR)</td> <td align="center">52 (46-59)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ethnicity</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Caucasian/White</td> <td align="center">0.76</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Asian/Pacific Islander</td> <td align="center">0.141</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Hispanic</td> <td align="center">0.029</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Mixed Race/Ethnicity</td> <td align="center">0.039</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">African American/Black</td> <td align="center">0.022</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">American Indian</td> <td align="center">0.001</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Other</td> <td align="center">0.009</td> </tr> <tr> <td>First degree relative with breast cancer</td> <td align="center">0.17</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Age at first birth</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Nulliparous</td> <td align="center">0.39</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Age&lt;20</td> <td align="center">0.043</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Age&gt;40</td> <td align="center">0.032</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Age&lt;30, &#8805;20</td> <td align="center">0.251</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="right">Age&gt;30, &#8804;40</td> <td align="center">0.282</td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><u>Measurement of Breast Density in Cohort</u>: Measurement of breast density is accomplished using an automated technique for all mammograms obtained by Dr. Shepherd using Single X-Ray absorptiometry (SXA). SXA measurement of breast density is done on approximately 30% of all screening mammograms. Below we describe the method for measurement of breast density by SXA by Dr. Shepherd&#39;s group and its validation and association with breast cancer. As we demonstrate below, breast density, as measured by SXA, is an automated, highly reproducible measure of the density of breast tissue and is associated with breast cancer risk.</p> <p><i>SXA for Quantifying Breast Density</i>: Single x-ray absorptiometry (SXA) was initially developed for measuring bone density. SXA can determine the fraction of each of two densities simultaneously using the fact the sample is a constant thickness, the thickness in known, and the total attenuation is known. In applying this technique to breast density, we assume a two compartment model: fat and non-fatty (fibroglandular tissue). We use a reference material composed of various concentrations of two materials: one which is the same density as fat and another which is the same density as fibroglandular tissue. The reference material (phantom) is placed in the X-ray field with each mammogram. We have been able to implement this in a way that is unintrusive to the patient and technologist at CPMC.</p> <p>Assuming this two-compartment model and a constant known breast thickness, we can then calculate the percent density at any region of the breast based on the assumption that % pixel grey-scale is proportion to the mass fractions of breast fat and lean tissue. If reference materials (a phantom) of fat and fibroglandular tissue are imaged with the patient&#39;s breast and the reference materials have the same thickness as the patient&#39;s breast, then the breast&#39;s grey-scale values can be converted to fat/fibroglandular mass fractions by interpolating between those two references. The total percent density is found by averaging the volume fraction over all breast pixels.</p> <p>The phantom being used for breast density assessment at CPMC began to be used in September 2004. The phantom does not have to be manipulated by the technologist and stays attached on the mammography device during standard craniocaudal (CC) views. Thus it creates minimal to no interference with the clinical mammogram.</p> <p><i>Reproducibility of breast density measures</i>: Traditional measures of mammographic density require some human interpretation. A human reader outlines the area perceived to be dense and a computer then calculates the percent area outlined as a percent of the entire image. Thus, while traditional mammographic density is associated with breast cancer risk, it has some limitations. In a study by Drs. Shepherd, Kerlikowske, et al., the correlation coefficient (Pearson&#39;s R) between different readers was 0.8-0.9.</p> <p>In contrast to the traditional mammographic density measurement, the SXA measurement is fully automated and, therefore, the reproducibility of the measurement is higher. Dr. Shepherd and colleagues have performed a replication study of SXA as a measurement of breast density. They have estimated the correlation coefficient of the SXA measurement of breast density to be &gt;0.98. Thus, as expected for an automated measure, SXA is a highly reproducible measure of mammographic breast density.</p> <p>Drs. Shepherd and Kerlikowske have recently analyzed the association between breast cancer risk and breast density as measured by SXA (Shepherd et al., Cancer Epi Biomarkers and Prev, 2011, PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21610220" target="_blank">21610220</a>). They found that women in the highest quintile of % volumetric density had an odds ratio of 4.1 (95% CI: 2.3 - 7.2) for breast cancer risk compared to women in the lowest quintile of volumetric density. Thus volumetric density appears to be a highly reproducible, automated measure of breast cancer.</p>	Breast Neoplasm;Mammography	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000395.v1.p1

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, in which intestinal anatomy is altered, dramatically ameliorates and/or eliminates Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in 50-80% of patients within hours to days following surgery, well before significant weight loss, in contrast to other types of bariatric surgeries, such as gastric banding, that attenuate insulin resistance as a result of substantial weight loss that occurs over months to years. The molecular mechanism by which RYGB exerts this clinical phenomenon occurs is not known. The goal of this project was to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with amelioration in T2D defined by medication independence. Identifying genetic variants that influence the dramatic resolution of T2D from RYGB may identify novel targets for pharmacological T2D therapies and/or identify patients in whom RYGB may not be effective.</p>	Type 2 Diabetes;Obesity;Bariatric Surgery	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000408.v1.p1

Samples for this study represented a cross-section of the different subtypes of pediatric AML. The only AML subtype that was an outlier from the above observations was acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AML FAB-M7), with the majority of these cases being characterized by complex chromosomal rearrangements and a high number of copy number alterations. To more fully define the genomic landscape of this subtype, we performed transcriptome sequence analysis on 14 pediatric FAB-M7 cases and mutation recurrence screening in a panel of 62 adult and pediatric AML FAB-M7 samples using the Illumina platform. Our results identified chromosomal rearrangements resulting in the expression of novel fusion transcripts in 11/14 cases. Remarkably, in 7/14 cases we detected an inversion on chromosome 16 that results in the juxtaposition of the CBFA2T3 gene next to the GLIS2 gene resulting in a CBFA2T3-GLIS2 chimeric gene that encoded an in frame fusion protein. This fusion led to the acquisition or preservation of self-renewal in colony forming assays, providing functional evidence for a role in leukemogenesis. In addition to novel chimeric transcripts, we found mutations in genes previously identified to play a role in megakaryoblastic leukemia that carry a proliferative advantage to the cell, such as JAK2 and MPL. These data demonstrate that AML FAB-M7 is characterized by cooperating Class I and Class II mutations leading to leukemogenesis.</p>	Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia;Acute Myeloid Leukemia	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000413.v2.p1

One of the best characterized subtypes of AML involves leukemias with alterations of the core-binding factor (CBF)-complex, which comprises the FAB subtypes M2 and M4Eo and associates with a favorable outcome. Patients with the AML M2 subtype harbor a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 [t(8;21)] that yields the chimeric fusion gene <i>RUNX1(AML1)-RUNX1T1(ETO)</i>, while patients with AML M4Eo express the chimeric fusion gene <i>CBF&#946;-SMMHC(MYH11)</i> as a result of an inversion/translocation event of chromosome 16 [inv(16)/t(16;16)]. In an effort to define the total complement of genetic changes in CBF-leukemia, we performed paired-end whole genome sequencing (WGS) on diagnostic leukemia blasts and matched germ line samples from 17 pediatric CBF-leukemia patients using the Illumina platform. Somatic alterations, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and structural variations (SVs), including insertions, deletions, inversions, and inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements, were detected using complementary analysis pipelines (Bambino, CREST and CONSERTING).

This study examines 269 subjects for gene expression (version 1) and 108 subjects for DNA methylation (version 2). The subjects are normal controls without neuropathological and neuropsychiatric diagnosis and range in age from fetal weeks 14-20 through old age (&gt;80). We discover fast changes in gene expression occurring during early brain development. Later in life, the changes are considerably slower. Many genes reverse pattern of expression between fetal and early postnatal development. We identify thousands of strong associations of SNPs with gene expression. We examine DNA methylation in ~14,500 genes at ~27,000 CpG loci focused on 5' promoter regions. The fastest changes in DNA methylation also occur during the prenatal period, slow down markedly after birth and continue to slow further with aging. DNA methylation is strongly associated with genotypic variants and correlates with expression of a subset of genes. DNA for genotyping was obtained from the cerebella and applied to either Illumina 650K or 1 million BeadArrays - only genotypes common to both platforms are analyzed here. Genotypes were called using BeadExpress software.

While the variant cosegregated with melanoma in some, but not all cases in the family, linkage analysis of 31 families subsequently identified to carry the variant generated a LOD score of 2.7 under a dominant model, suggesting E318K as a possible intermediate risk variant. Consistent with this, E318K was significantly associated with melanoma in a large Australian case-control sample, giving an odds ratio (OR) of 2.33, 95% CI 1.21-4.70 (case and control carrier frequency, 0.0165 and 0.0072, respectively; P=0.008). Likewise, it was similarly associated in an independent case-control sample from the United Kingdom (UK P=0.012; combined P=0.0003, OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.41-3.45). In the Australian sample, the variant allele was significantly over-represented in cases with a family history of melanoma (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.23-6.92), multiple primary melanomas (OR 4.22, 95% CI 1.52-10.91), or both (OR 8.37, 95% CI 2.58-23.80). The variant allele was also associated with increased nevus count (combined P=0.002, OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.42-4.55) and non-blue eye color (combined P=0.008, OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.11-3.81). Functional analysis of E318K showed that MITF encoded by the variant allele had impaired sumoylation and differentially regulated several MITF targets. These data indicate that MITF is a melanoma predisposition gene and highlights the utility of whole-genome sequencing to identify novel rare variants associated with disease susceptibility.</p>	Melanoma	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000419.v1.p1

It was launched in 2010 as a two-year pilot project supported by the Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH). GTEx will create a database that researchers can use to study how inherited changes in genes lead to common diseases.</p> <p>GTEx researchers are studying genes in different tissues obtained from many different people. The GTEx project also includes a study to explore the effectiveness of the GTEx donor consent process - this study will help ensure that the consent process and other aspects of the project effectively address the concerns and expectations of participants in the study. GTEx is a pioneering project that uses state-of-the-art protocols for obtaining and storing a large range of organs and tissues and for testing them in the lab. Until now, no project has analyzed genetic variation and expression in as many tissues in such a large population as planned for GTEx.</p> <p><b>Scientific Description</b></p> <p>Understanding the role of variation in the human genome is crucial to elucidating genetic contributions to human health and disease. Despite the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) documenting strong statistical associations between genetic variation and human traits, the functional role for most of these variants is largely unexplained. Nearly 90% of these GWAS-implicated sites lie outside of protein-coding sequences, suggesting that these variants might regulate gene expression.</p> <p>The goal of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is to establish a resource database in which to study the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in reference/non-diseased tissues. The ultimate resource would include up to 1,000 post-mortem donors with several dozen tissues from each, a resource large enough to study both <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>- gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Some tissue will also be banked for additional molecular analyses.</p> <p>GTEx was funded as a 2-year pilot project by the NIH Common Fund (CF), and will assess the feasibility of collecting high-quality RNA from multiple tissues from healthy donors. The project will collect and analyze RNA levels in 30 or more different human tissues from 160 postmortem donors and 5 tissues from a similar number of surgical controls. Each donor will be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping arrays.</p> <p>By treating RNA expression levels as quantitative traits, eQTLs will be identified as sites containing genetic variation that correlate with changes in RNA expression. Such eQTLs have been associated with 4%-12% of expressed human genes, and with common complex human diseases, including obesity, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, Crohn&#39;s disease, and asthma. Additionally, few studies have examined the tissue specificity of eQTLs. The GTEx project will thus serve as a resource database and tissue bank for many future studies, especially for understanding the functional basis of inherited susceptibility to disease.</p> <p>It is anticipated that GTEx data will be made available through dbGaP on a periodic basis as it is generated.</p>	Reference Values	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v3.p1

To identify the genetic basis of interindividual variability     in methotrexate pharmacokinetics in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we performed a genome-wide     analysis (GWAS) of 500,568 germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 434 children with ALL who received 3,014 courses of     methotrexate at 2 to 5 g/m2. SNPs were validated in an independent cohort of 206 patients. Adjusting for age, race, sex, and     methotrexate regimen, the most significant associations were with SNPs in the organic anion transporter polypeptide, <i>SLCO1B1</i>     (rs11045879 (P = 1.7 x 10<sup>-10</sup>) and rs4149081 (P = 1.7 x 10<sup>-9</sup>) (Trevino et al, PMID:     <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19901119" target="_blank">19901119</a>). To test whether rare variants in <i>SLCO1B1</i>     could alter its function, we genotyped <i>SLCO1B1</i> exons in a slightly larger group of 699 children with ALL who received     methotrexate and identified 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  We found several common and rare non-synonymous (NS) SNPs     associated with methotrexate clearance.</p>     <p>NS SNPs predicted to be functionally damaging (common or rare) were more likely to be found among patients with the lowest     adjusted methotrexate clearance (lowest 10%) than patients with high clearance (highest 10%).  Four <i>SLCO1B1</i> haplotypes were     associated with reduced methotrexate clearance and we verified that these haplotypes have lower function with in vitro transport assays.     We were able to quantitatively account for a third of the population variability in clearance of methotrexate with clinical and     genetic covariates.  This data set includes the dependent variable of methotrexate clearance and all of the SNP data available from     arrays, sequencing, and genotyping.</p>	Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000426.v1.p1
phs000428.v1.p1	Health and Retirement Study (HRS)	12507	Longitudinal	HumanOmni2.5	GWAS	European American, African American	Both	50	\N	<p><b>Description:</b> The University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of Americans over the age of 50. Supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA U01AG009740) and the Social Security Administration, the HRS is designed to provide reliable data on the decisions, choices, and behaviors of people as they age and respond to changes in public policy, the economy, and health.</p> <p>The study obtains information every two years about income and wealth, health and use of health services, work and retirement, and family connections. Through its unique and in-depth interviews, the HRS provides an invaluable and growing body of multidisciplinary data that researchers can use to address important questions about the challenges and opportunities of aging. Because of its innovation and importance, the HRS has become the model and hub for a growing network of harmonized longitudinal aging studies around the world.</p> <p><b>Origins of the HRS.</b> As the population ages it is increasingly important to obtain reliable data about aging and topics that are relevant to a range of policy issues in aging. To address this need, the National Institutes on Aging (NIA) established a cooperative agreement with the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research to collect such data. The HRS launched data collection in 1992 and has re-interviewed the original sample of respondents every two years since then. By adding new cohorts and refreshing the sample, the HRS has grown to become the largest, most representative longitudinal panel study of Americans 50 years and older.</p> <p><b>HRS Study Design.</b> The target population for the original HRS cohort includes all adults in the contiguous United States born during the years 1931-1941 who reside in households, with a 2:1 oversample of African-American and Hispanic populations. The original sample is refreshed with new birth cohorts (51-56 years of age) every six years. The sample has been expanded over the years to include a broader range of birth cohorts as well. The target population for the AHEAD survey consists of United States household residents who were born in 1923 or earlier. Children of the Depression (CODA) recruits households born 1924-1930, Warbabies 1942-47, Early Boomers 1948-53, and Mid-Boomers 1954-59. The current sample is over 26,000 persons in 17,000 households.</p> <p>Data collection includes a mixed mode design combining in-person, telephone, mail, and Internet. For consenting respondents, HRS data is linked at the individual level to administrative records from Social Security and Medicare claims.</p> <p><b>Genetic Research in the HRS.</b> The HRS is now genotyping 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on respondents using Illumina&#39;s Human Omni2.5-Quad (Omni2.5) BeadChip methodology. The genotyping is being performed by the NIH Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Saliva was collected on half of the HRS sample each wave starting in 2006. In 2006, saliva was collected using a mouthwash collection method. In 2008, the data collection method switched to the Oragene kit. Saliva completion rates were 83% in 2006 and 84% in 2008. Based on prior rates of consent and completion, we expect an additional 6,000 Oragene samples to be added by 2012, including a substantial expansion of the minority sample. </p> <p><b>HRS Phenotypic data.</b> Phenotypic data are available on a variety of dimensions. Health measures include physical/psychological self-report, various health conditions, disabilities; cognitive performance; health behaviors (smoking, drinking, exercise), physical performance and anthropomorphic measures, and biomarkers (HbA1c, Total Cholesterol, HDL, CRP, Cystatin-C). Data are also available on health services including utilization, insurance and out-of-pocket spending with linkage to Medicare records. Economic measures include employment status/history, earnings, disability, retirement, type of work, income by source, wealth by asset type, capital gains/debt, consumption, linkage to pensions, Social Security earnings/benefit histories. There is also extensive information on family structure, proximity, transfers to/from of money, time, social and psychological characteristics, as well as a wide range of demographics.</p> <p>Performance on a cognitive test combining immediate and delayed word recall was selected as an example trait for the dbGaP data release. In the immediate word recall task the interviewer reads a list of 10 nouns to the respondent and asks the respondent to recall as many words as possible from the list in any order. After approximately five minutes of asking other survey questions, the respondent is asked to recall the nouns previously presented as part of the immediate recall task. The total recall score is the sum of the correct answers to these two tasks, with a range of 0 to 20. </p> <p>Researchers who wish to link to other HRS measures not in dbGaP will be able to apply for access from HRS. A separate Data Use Agreement (DUA) will be required for linkage to the HRS data.

The HALT-C Trial was developed to determine whether prolonged interferon therapy altered histological and clinical outcomes in a group of patients who had failed to eradicate hepatitis C virus with previous interferon treatment.</p> <p><b>Study Hypotheses</b></p> <p> <ol> <li>In patients with chronic hepatitis C and bridging fibrosis who failed to eradicate the virus with previous interferon therapy, long-term treatment with interferon is safe and can prevent progression to cirrhosis.</li> <li>In patients with cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C who failed to eradicate the virus with previous interferon therapy, long-term treatment with interferon is safe and can reduce the risks of hepatic decompensation or of hepatocellular carcinoma.</li> </ol> </p> <p><b>Study Design</b></p> <p>1145 patients with chronic HCV and advanced hepatic fibrosis (Ishak stage 3-6) who failed to respond to previous treatment with interferon were enrolled at 10 clinical centers and entered into a Lead-in phase. They were treated with a combination of pegylated interferon (Pegasys&#174;, Hoffmann-La Roche) 180 &#181;g/week and ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day) for 24 weeks. Patients who had no detectable HCV-RNA at week 20 continued on combination therapy until week 48.</p> <p>662 patients who did not clear virus were randomly assigned at week 24 to either continue treatment with pegylated interferon alone (90 &#181;g/week) for an additional 42 months, or to have treatment discontinued. All patients were followed at 3-month intervals following randomization. Liver biopsy was performed at baseline and after 1.5 and 3.5 years of treatment.</p> <p>Because of slower than expected enrollment and the approval by the FDA of peginterferon alfa-2b after the start of the trial, we modified the study protocol in three ways. First, criteria for admission to the trial were liberalized to allow patients to enter the trial with lower platelet and white blood cell counts than had been initially considered safe or tolerable. Second, 151 Lead-in patients and those continuing on therapy after 24 weeks who demonstrated return of viremia during or after their 48-week treatment period (called "Breakthrough" or "Relapse" patients, respectively) were allowed to return to enter the randomized trial. Third, 237 patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2b (or with peginterferon alfa-2a in licensing trials) outside the HALT-C Trial who in other respects met all study criteria, having received the equivalent of Trial Lead-in period therapy, were allowed to enter the long-term trial as "Express" patients.</p> <p>A total 1050 patients were randomized.</p> <p>Those patients who completed Month 48 were offered an "extended follow-up (observation only)" until October 2009. These visits will primarily be to identify outcome events, and to provide information to patients concerning the current status of the trial.

The African American (AA) population from the Sea Islands of coastal South Carolina and Georgia has high rates of type 2 diabetes, low levels of admixture, and in general, consume a diet rich in saturated fats. We postulate that this unique combination of ancestral and environmental factors results in a more consistent penetrance of diabetes risk alleles, as well as enrichment of risk alleles of African origin. The existing DNA samples and rich phenotypic data from the Sea Island Families Project comprise a unique resource for genetic studies of type 2 diabetes and related metabolic traits such as dyslipidemia. Our central hypothesis is that the increased risk for T2DM in AA compared with European American (EA) is due, in part, to susceptibility alleles of African origin, and that these alleles can be identified using a GWAS. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Identify genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes utilizing DNA samples and data from the Sea Island Families Project, Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study recruited from SC, GA, NC, and AL; and a GWAS approach; 2) Identify genetic contributors to lipoprotein subclasses in African Americans using the lipoprotein subclass profile (particle size and concentration for multiple subclasses of VLDL, LDL, and HDL) assessed by NMR at LipoScience, Inc., and the GWAS data from Aim 1. The rationale for this project is that identification and validation of novel pathophysiological pathways and informed selection of candidate genes for diabetes risk will inform development of new, targeted prevention and treatment strategies in this underserved, high risk population.</p>	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus;Dyslipidemia	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000433.v1.p1

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) focusing on subjects with a history of atrial fibrillation. Rate control therapy for AF uses a range of drugs (beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis) to depress conduction through the AV node, thereby preventing rapid rates and minimizing symptoms. In large groups of patients, such as the Vanderbilt AF Registry (a clinical and genetic repository with over 1200 patients with ECG-confirmed AF) from which these study subjects were drawn, approximately 5% display failure of aggressive AV nodal-blocking therapy to control ventricular rate. In these patients, interruption of the AV node by ablation and pacemaker implantation are necessary for adequate rate control.</p> <p>Study cases were individuals who underwent AV node ablation and pacemaker implantation after combined therapy with 3 AV nodal-blocking agents was ineffective in rate control. Controls for this study were individuals who met standardized rate-control efficacy criteria (as described in AFFIRM study, Wyse et al, NEJM 2002; PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12466506" target="_blank">12466506</a>) for optimal rate control with 2 or fewer AV nodal-blocking agents.

This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, <a href="http://www.genevastudy.org" target="_blank">http://www.genevastudy.org</a>), which was developed through the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). Furthermore this study brings together multiple research priorities of the University of Pittsburgh Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics (<a href="http://www.ccdg.pitt.edu" target="_blank">www.ccdg.pitt.edu</a>). A genome-wide panel of 610,000 SNPs was genotyped at the Broad Institute to be comparable to our other pertinent GENEVA studies that are also part of dbGaP (dbGaP accession number <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap?term=phs000095">phs000095</a>, "Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies" and dbGaP accession number <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap?term=phs000094">phs000094</a>, "International Consortium to Identify Genes and Interactions Controlling Oral Clefts"). The goal of this study is to investigate genetic determinants to dental caries and to OFCs in a novel study population. To date, most genetic studies of dental caries have been conducted in Caucasians, and of OFCs in Caucasians and Asians. The Guatemalan population under study is rural and ethnically mixed with a high proportion of Native-South-Americans.</p> <p>Thirty-six Guatemalans from this dataset were also part of the recent GWAS studies of cleft lip and cleft palate (Beaty et al., 2010 and 2011, dbGaP Study Accession: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap?term=phs000094">phs000094</a>, "International Consortium to Identify Genes and Interactions Controlling Oral Clefts"). In addition to the families ascertained in Guatemala, some subjects were genotyped with this cohort to augment the data in the parent GENEVA study (Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies, dbGaP accession number <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap?term=phs000095">phs000095</a>), in particular individuals from the IOWA and PITT GENEVA study sites. Their data are available with the parent study.</p> <p>Dental caries (also known as tooth decay) remains the most common chronic disease of childhood, five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than environmental allergies, with more than 40% of children exhibiting caries when they enter kindergarten. In 2005, it was estimated that dental health care costs were approximately $84 billion, of which 60% or about $50 billion were related to treatment of dental caries. The etiology of dental caries has been studied for many years. Multiple factors contribute to a person&#39;s risk for caries, including: 1) environmental factors such as diet, oral hygiene, fluoride exposure and the level of colonization of cariogenic bacteria and 2) host factors such as salivary flow, salivary buffering capacity, position of teeth relative to each other, surface characteristics of tooth enamel and depth of occlusal fissures on posterior teeth. In spite of all that is known about this disease, there are still individuals who appear to be more susceptible to caries and those who are extremely resistant, regardless of the environmental risk factors to which they are exposed, implying that genetic factors also play an important role in caries etiology. This conclusion is supported by studies in both humans and animals, with the most compelling evidence coming from studies of twins reared apart in which investigators found significant resemblance within monozygotic (MZ) but not dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs for percentage of teeth and surfaces restored or carious and estimated the genetic contribution to caries as 40%. Other recent studies of twins reared together estimated the heritability for caries, adjusted for age and gender, as ranging from 45-64%. In our study populations of families, we also estimated caries heritability as approximately 54%-70% of variation in primary dentition caries scores and 35%-55% in the permanent dentition (Wang et al., 2010).</p> <p>Orofacial clefts (OFCs), particularly cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and isolated cleft palate (CP) are a major public health problem, affecting one in every 500-1000 births worldwide thus representing the most common facial birth defect and one of the most common of all congenital anomalies. CL/P is a major structural birth defect that is notable for significant lifelong morbidity and complex etiology. The extensive psychological, surgical, speech and dental involvement emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying causes of CL/P. Therefore, many research groups have attempted to elucidate the etiology of CL/P, with some recent success by our research group and others (see Beaty et al., 2010, 2011; Dixon et al., 2011). It is clear that CL/P can occur as part of Mendelian syndromes, that certain chromosomal abnormalities include CL/P in the phenotype, and that certain teratogens can increase the risk of having an offspring with CL/P. However, phenotypes of known etiology comprise only a small portion of all individuals with a CL/P or CP, and the major focus of research into OFCs is to develop an understanding of the etiology of nonsyndromic (NS) forms of clefting. A major focus of the University of Pittsburgh CCDG has been to study additional phenotypes within nonsyndromic OFC families in order to identify sub-clinical expressions of OFC risk genes or risk variants, e.g. SNPs (see Weinberg et al., 2006). A detailed oral exam is conducted as part of these extended phenotypic studies, including a dental caries exam.</p> <p>Note that although there are some reports in the literature of higher caries experience in individuals with clefts, the most recent meta-analysis of those literature reports concluded that individuals born with these defects do not have a higher frequency of caries (Hassl&#246;f and Twetman, 2007). Notably, we investigated the association of CL/P and caries in three of our study populations (including part of the Guatemalan population in this GWAS study) and also found no increase in caries rates of CL/P cases versus controls (Jindal et al., 2011).</p> <p>This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, <a href="http://www.genevastudy.org" target="_blank">http://www.genevastudy.org</a>), which was developed through the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to dental caries and oral clefts through large-scale genome-wide association studies of well-characterized Guatemalan families and individuals. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The study was supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR, U01-DE018903).

Its diagnosis is important for the identification of patients who are at high risk of having reversible causes of hypertension and/or patients who, because of persistently high blood pressure levels, may benefit from special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. Resistant hypertension represents an extreme phenotype, thus, it has been predicted that genetic factors could play a larger role than for the general hypertensive population.

We      characterized one ncRNA, PCAT-1, as a prostate-specific regulator of cell proliferation and show that it is a target of the polycomb      repressive complex 2 (PRC2). We further found that patterns of PCAT-1 and PRC2 expression stratified patient tissues into molecular subtypes      distinguished by expression signatures of PCAT-1-repressed target genes. Taken together, our findings suggest that PCAT-1 is a transcriptional      repressor implicated in a subset of prostate cancer patients.

Studies of candidate genes resulted in the discovery of a 32bp deletion in the CC-chemokine receptor 5 gene (CCR5&#916;32), which rendered this critical co-receptor for primary HIV infection to be non-functional. Pharmacologic and vaccine-induced blockade of CCR5 is being pursued to treat and prevent HIV infection and other conditions.</p> <p>The allele frequency of CCR5&#916;32 among persons of European ancestry is approximately 10%. CCR5&#916;32/&#916;32 homozygotes are almost totally resistant to HIV infection. People with severe hemophilia A require frequent replacement with clotting Factor VIII (FVIII) to control hemorrhage. Prior to the discovery of HIV in 1984 and licensure of recombinant FVIII in the late 1980s, people with severe hemophilia A were treated with plasma-derived FVIII and thus were intensively exposed to HIV. Only 5% of such patients were not infected with HIV. Of these, approximately 1/3 were CCR5&#916;32/&#916;32 homozygotes. The remaining 2/3 of these people who were highly resistant to HIV remain unexplained. This project seeks to discover genome variations among people who are highly resistant to HIV infection. Such variation is likely to serve as a target for reducing the morbidity and incidence of HIV. </p>	HIV;Hemophilia A	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000445.v1.p1

We identified recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL, as well as in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously suspected. Significantly mutated genes include MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, CREBBP, as well as MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO and TNFRSF14. Analysis of somatic mutations in patients with DLBCL also revealed that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2/IgH rearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily synonymous, likely caused by AID-mediated somatic hypermutation, and those non-synonymous mutations that are observed tend to be found outside of the functionally important BH domains of the protein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function mutations is at play. We further identified genes with mutations that are likely to be functionally relevant despite being mutated at a low rate. These genes include KRAS, BRAF and NOTCH1 as likely drivers of DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL. These data may point towards new targets for the treatment of DLBCL. </p>	Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000450.v1.p1

In this report, we describe the complete genomic sequences of male and female supercentenarians, both age &gt;114 years old. We show that: (1) the sequence variant spectrum of these two individuals&#39; DNA sequences is largely comparable to existing non-supercentenarian genomes; (2) the two individuals do not appear to carry most of the well-established human longevity enabling variants already reported in the literature; (3) they have a comparable number of known disease-associated variants relative to most human genomes sequenced to date; (4) approximately 1% of the variants these individuals possess are novel and may point to new genes involved in exceptional longevity; and (5) both individuals are enriched for longevity-associated variants that we discovered through a large genome-wide association study. These analyses suggest that there are both common and rare longevity associated variants that may counter the effects of disease predisposing variants and extend lifespan. The continued analysis of the genomes of these rare individuals who have survived to extremely old ages should provide insight into the processes that contribute to the maintenance of health during extreme ageing.</p>	Aging;Longevity;Centenarian	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000451.v1.p1

Importantly, this large class of disorders co-occurs with more common developmental disorders such as autism, mental retardation and some forms of infantile epilepsy, and shares some of the same causes. With this renewal, we propose to expand the scope of our work beyond single phenotypes and genes to focus on delineating the critical phenotype spectra to which the most common MHM belong, and defining the underlying biological networks that are disrupted. </p> <p>To pursue these goals, we will use our large and growing cohort of human subjects to map additional MHM loci using SNP microarrays that provide both high-resolution autozygosity and linkage data in informative families as well as detect critical copy number variants in sporadic subjects. The causative genes will be identified using traditional Sanger or new high-throughput sequencing methods as appropriate abased on size of the critical region. We will use these and other known MHM causative genes to construct and revise model biological networks of genes and proteins, and test these genes and networks in additional patients as a candidate gene or more accurately a candidate network approach. These approaches need to be supported by ongoing active subject recruitment, as studies of comparable disorders such as mental retardation and autism have benefited from even larger numbers of subjects that we have so far collected. We need to use new high-throughput sequencing methods to more efficiently test larger critical regions, and to test entire gene networks rather than individual genes in matched cohorts of subjects. At every step; phenotype analysis, CNV analysis, model network construction and high-throughput sequencing, we will need expanded bioinformatics capabilities. Finally, we need to test the biological function of new genes and networks to support our gene identification studies. We expect that these studies will contribute immediately to more accurate diagnosis and counseling, and over time will lead to development of specific treatments for a subset of these disorders. We further expect that studies of mid-hindbrain development will have broad significance for human developmental disorders generally, providing compelling evidence for a connection between cerebellar development and other classes of developmental disorders such as autism, mental retardation and epilepsy.</p> <p> Study 2<br/> R01-NS058721 (PI: DOBYNS, William B.)<br/> De novo copy number variation and gene discovery in human brain malformations<br/> Project Summary/Abstract<br/> The number of recognized brain malformations and syndromes has grown rapidly during the past several decades, yet relatively few causative genes have been identified, especially for three common malformations that have been associated with numerous cytogenetically visible chromosome deletions and duplications, and that often occur together: agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (CVH) including Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM), and polymicrogyria (PMG). We propose to perform high-resolution array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH), emerging technology able to detect small copy number variants (CNV), in 700 probands with one or more of these three malformations. Our central hypothesis states that more than 10% of patients with ACC, CVH or PMG will have <i>de novo</i> CNV below the resolution of routine cytogenetic analysis, but detectable by current array platforms. We therefore expect to identify 70-100 patients with small CNV. We will distinguish CNV found in normal individuals from potentially disease-associated changes, and will confirm CNV using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and microsatellite (STRP) analysis. We will give highest priority to CNV that are <i>de novo</i> and involve 2 or more BACs, and secondary priority to familial and smaller CNV excluding known polymorphisms. After that, we will evaluate and rank candidate genes in the critical regions using information from public databases and our own expression studies, and perform mutation analysis of the best candidate genes from well-defined critical regions by sequencing in a large panel of subjects with phenotypes that match the phenotypes of the patients whose CNV define the critical regions. Here, we will use more refined criteria to supplement our clinical classification, such as the developmental level and presence of epilepsy or other birth defects. Any abnormalities found will be analyzed using existing data regarding polymorphisms (i.e. dbSNP), cross-species comparisons, and functional assays appropriate for the specific sequence change. </p> <p> Study 2A<br/> In 1995, we described a novel multiple congenital anomaly syndrome associated with facial dysmorphism (congenital ptosis, high arched eyebrows, shallow orbits, trigonocephaly), colobomas of the eyes, neuronal migration malformation (frontal predominant lissencephaly) and variable hearing loss. We hypothesized from <i>de novo</i> mutations and used trio-based exome sequencing to identify <i>de novo</i> mutations in the ACTB and ACTG1 genes. </p> <p> Study 2B<br/> In 1997 and 2004, we and others defined two novel developmental syndromes associated with markedly enlarged brain size, or megalencephaly, and other highly recognizable features. The megalencephaly-capillary malformation syndrome (MCAP) consists of megalencephaly and associated growth dysregulation with variable asymmetry, developmental vascular anomalies, distal limb malformations, variable cortical malformation, and a mild connective tissue dysplasia. The megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH) resembles MCAP but lacks vascular malformations and syndactyly. We hypothesized that MCAP and MPPH result from mutations - including postzygotic events - in the same pathway, and studied them together. Using a combination of exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, restriction-enzyme assays, and targeted ultra-deep sequencing in 50 families with MCAP or MPPH, we identified <i>de novo</i> germline or postzygotic mutations in three core components of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT pathway.

Risk Assessment of Cerebrovascular Events (RACE) is an on-going existing case-control study of stroke now involving over 5000 imaging confirmed cases of stroke and 5000 controls, recruited from seven centers in Pakistan. The study is aimed to investigate the genetic, biomarker and lifestyle determinants of stroke and its subtypes. Cases are <b>eligible for inclusion</b> in the study if they: (i) are aged at least 18 years; (ii) present with a sudden onset of neurological deficit respecting a vascular territory with sustained deficit at 24 hours verified by medical attention within 72 hours after onset (onset is defined by when the patient was last seen normal and not when found with deficit); and (iii) the diagnosis is supported by CT/MRI; and (iv) present with a Modified Rankin Score &lt; 2 prior to the stroke. Findings from patient&#39;s history, 12-lead ECG and CT or MRI of the brain. The mandatory procedures for inclusion in this investigation are: (i) clinical verification of cerebrovascular event within 72 hours of onset; (ii) neuroimaging CT (non-contrast) or MRI (MRI is not a mandatory investigation but recorded whenever ordered by the attending physician); and (iii) 12-lead ECG. All other ancillary investigations ordered by the attending physician are recorded as well. The TOAST classification method is used to classify ischemic stroke based on aetiology whereas the Oxfordshire classification is used to classify stroke neuro-anatomically.</p> <p>Control participants for this subset of young onset stroke were individuals enrolled in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS), a case-control study of acute MI based in Pakistan. RACE capitalizes on the genetic data (including information on GWAS) that has already been collected from the healthy participants enrolled in PROMIS. RACE and PROMIS share similar methodology of recruitment. Participants from both these investigations are derived from similar catchment areas, hence providing an attractive opportunity for RACE to utilize PROMIS controls as common controls for genetic investigations. Controls in PROMIS were recruited following procedures and inclusion criteria as adopted for RACE cases. In order to minimize any potential selection biases, PROMIS controls selected for this stroke substudy were frequency matched to RACE cases based on age and gender and were recruited in the following order of priority: (1) non-blood related or blood related visitors of patients of the out-patient department; (2) non-blood related visitors of stroke patients; (3) patients of the out-patient department presenting with minor complaints (e.g. back pain, minor gastric complaints). Control subjects from the PROMIS study were genotyped at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute on the Illumina 660W Quad array.

T2D-GENES Project 2 is a complex pedigree-based study designed to identify low frequency or rare variants influencing susceptibility to T2D, using whole genome sequence (WGS) information from 1,043 individuals in 20 Mexican American T2D-enriched pedigrees from San Antonio, Texas. The major objectives of this study are to identify low frequency or rare variants in and around known common variant signals for T2D, as well as to find novel low frequency or rare variants influencing susceptibility to T2D.</p> <p>The sampled individuals are obtained from two studies: the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) and the San Antonio Family Diabetes/Gallbladder Study (SAFDGS), collectively referred to as the San Antonio Mexican American Family Studies (SAMAFS). The strategy is to sequence approximately 600 individuals at an average of 50x coverage across the entire genome, then impute genome wide genotypes for about 440 additional family members. The 600 sequenced individuals are specifically chosen for their value in imputing sequence information into other family members. By studying large pedigrees, we expect to find multiple individuals carrying each genetic variant, even if this variant is very rare in the population at large. Thus, a pedigree-based approach provides an excellent opportunity for identifying rare novel variants influencing risk of T2D and quantitative variation in T2D-related phenotypes. The whole genome sequencing has been done commercially by Complete Genomics, Inc. (CGI).</p> <p>The final data set includes whole genome sequence data for 607 individuals. After quality control, 585 sequenced individuals provide data for family based imputation, using Merlin linkage analysis software, into approximately 440 additional family members for whom chip based genotypes are available to indicate which parental haplotype is transmitted.</p> <p>Extensive phenotype data is provided for 1048 individuals. These include 5 sequenced individuals who do not belong to any of the 20 large pedigrees. Phenotype information was collected between 1991 and 2011 in the two contributing longitudinal studies. SAFHS participants may have information from up to 5 visits, and SAFDGS participants may have up to 4 visits. The clinical variables reported are coordinated with T2D-GENES Project 1 (multi-ethnic exome sequencing) and include T2D status and age at diagnosis, glycemic traits (fasting and 2 hour glucose and insulin), blood pressure, blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, calculated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), clinical chemistry (cystatin c, glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody titer (GadAb), creatinine, adiponectin and leptin). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was not measured for these individuals and insulin C-peptide is not included in this data set. Additional phenotype data include the medication status at each visit, classified in four categories as any current use of diabetes, hypertension or lipid-lowering medications, and, for females, current use of female hormones. Anthropometric measurements include age, sex, height, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference and derived ratios. Each phenotype variable has an initial summary column containing the most recent non-missing measurement for each individual, followed by the five potential time points for each individual, the number of non-missing measurements, and the age and year for the most recent non-missing measurement. For historical reasons, the order in which variables are presented on the dbGaP web site differs from their order in the data download file.

One of the most important regulators of blood calcium levels is parathyroid hormone (PTH), which mediates its actions through the PTH/PTHrP receptor, a G&#945;s-coupled receptor. Few inherited disorders are characterized by diminished blood calcium levels and elevated blood phosphate levels; some of these disorders are caused by too little PTH synthesis and/or secretion (hypoparathyroidism, HP), while others are caused by resistance towards PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism, PHP). Only few of the inherited forms of HP (&lt;10&#37;) have been defined at the molecular level. In contrast, genetic mutations have been identified for several inherited forms of PHP. For example, PHP type Ia (PHP-Ia) is caused by maternally inherited mutations in those GNAS exons that encode G&#945;s, while autosomal dominant PHP type Ib (AD-PHP-Ib) is caused by maternal inherited deletions within or up-stream of GNAS, which are associated with abnormal GNAS methylation. However, a large number of patients with PTH-resistance and thus hypocalcemia show GNAS methylation changes, but their underlying genetic defects have not yet been defined at the DNA level. These &#34;sporadic&#34; patients may be affected by an autosomal recessive form of PHP-Ib (AR-PHP-Ib), which is most likely not linked to the GNAS locus. In our studies, we propose to search through exome sequence analyses for novel genetic mutations responsible for novel autosomal dominant forms of HP that are not caused by mutations in the known disease-causing genes; some of these families are large enough to perform genetic linkage studies. We furthermore propose to search for the genetic mutation(s) responsible for the autosomal recessive variant of PHP-Ib through the analysis of whole exome sequences; for these studies we focus particularly on patients, whose parents are likely to be consanguineous. The proposed efforts are expected to lead to the identification of novel genes that are involved in parathyroid development and function (HP) and genes that are involved in the establishment or maintenance of GNAS methylation (AR-PHP-Ib). </p>	Hypoparathyroidism familial isolated;Pseudohypoparathyroidism	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000476.v1.p1

It has many detrimental effects for affected individuals, including functional visual loss from amblyopia, secondary psychosocial difficulties, and limited employment opportunities. Strabismus also imposes a significant economical burden on society from the cost of screening programs, surgical correction, and lost productivity. Congenital incomitant strabismus is a broad term that encompasses congenital ocular motility disorders with restricted movement in one or more directions of gaze, and includes various forms of Duane&apos;s retraction syndrome, horizontal gaze palsy, congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles, and Moebius syndrome. Incomitant strabismus together with a group of related disorders such as congenital ptosis and congenital facial palsy have been collectively redefined as congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs). This redefinition stemmed from previous studies in the Engle lab showing that these disorders can be caused by mutations in genes encoding transcription factors critical to ocular cranial motor neuron development and by genes that encode proteins essential to the proper growth and guidance of developing axons. Thus, while these disorders account for only a small percent of strabismus, understanding their genetic etiology has led to our ability to provide genetic testing and counseling, and has provided the first insights into the molecular etiologies of strabismus. While the Engle lab has identified all seven CCDD genes published to date, our cohort still includes &gt;100 familial CCDD pedigrees that are mutation-negative. We continue to utilize co-segregation analysis and whole exome or whole genome sequencing technologies to identify new disease genes in this mutation-negative cohort.</p>	Strabismus;Facial Paralysis;Blepharoptosis	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000478.v1.p1

Most cases of SCID result from either X-linked or autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in a known causative gene. However, in some cases, the molecular etiology remains unclear. To identify the cause of SCID in a patient known to lack the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45, we utilized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays and whole exome sequencing. The patient&#39;s mother was heterozygous for an inactivating mutation in <i>CD45</i>, while the paternal alleles lacked mutations. The patient exhibited a single <i>CD45</i> mutation identical to the maternal allele. Patient SNP array analysis revealed no change in copy number but loss of heterozygosity for the entire length of chromosome 1 (Chr1), indicating that disease was caused by uniparental disomy (UPD) with isodisomy of the entire maternal Chr1 bearing the <i>CD45</i> mutation. Non-lymphoid blood cells and other mesoderm and ectoderm-derived tissues retained UPD of the entire maternal Chr1 in this patient who had undergone successful bone marrow transplantation. Exome sequencing revealed mutations in 7 additional genes bearing nonsynonymous SNPs predicted to have deleterious effects. These findings represent the first reported case of SCID caused by UPD and suggest UPD should be considered in SCID and other recessive disorders, especially when the patient appears homozygous for an abnormal gene found in only one parent. Evaluation for alterations in other genes affected by UPD should also be considered in such cases.</p>	Severe Combined Immunodeficiency	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000479.v1.p1

Under the hypothesis that de novo mutations underlie a substantial fraction of the risk for developing ASD in families with no previous history of ASD or related phenotypes-so-called sporadic or simplex families-we sequenced all coding regions of the genome (the exome) for parent-child trios exhibiting sporadic ASD, including 189 new trios and 20 that were previously reported. Additionally, we also sequenced the exomes of 50 unaffected siblings corresponding to these new (n = 31) and previously reported trios (n = 19), for a total of 617 individual exomes from 209 families deposited in dbGaP. Here we show that de novo point mutations are overwhelmingly paternal in origin (4:1 bias) and positively correlated with paternal age, consistent with the modest increased risk for children of older fathers to develop ASD. Moreover, 39% (49 of 126) of the most severe or disruptive de novo mutations map to a highly interconnected beta-catenin/chromatin remodelling protein network ranked significantly for autism candidate genes. In proband exomes, recurrent protein-altering mutations were observed in two genes: CHD8 and NTNG1. Mutation screening of six candidate genes in 1,703 ASD probands identified additional de novo, protein-altering mutations in GRIN2B, LAMC3 and SCN1A. Combined with copy number variant (CNV) data, these results indicate extreme locus heterogeneity but also provide a target for future discovery, diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>	Autistic Disorder;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000482.v1.p1

The most common phenotype is left-sided posterolateral (Bochdalek-type) hernia accompanied by pulmonary hypoplasia. Due to the high mortality, most of the cases have no family history for CDH. The rare presumed Mendelian instances of CDH have the potential to be extremely informative about the molecular mechanisms generating this phenotype.

Additional altered genes suggest that deregulation of signaling pathways normally involved in MZ development (NOTCH, NF-kappa B, and B-cell receptor) represents a critical event in SMZL pathogenesis.

It is part of Pervasive Developmental Disorder characterized by impairments in communication, language and reciprocal social interaction, and by unusual patterns of restricted and repetitive interests or behaviors. Autism, or autistic disorder, is the most severe form of the disease which has a wide range of symptom severity encompassed by the more inclusive term, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The prevalence of Autistic Disorder is currently estimated to be 4 per 1000, affecting 4 times more boys than girls. Susceptibility to autism is clearly attributable to genetic factors but the extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity within the disorder have hindered efforts at genetic dissection. Identifying the genetic variants that contribute to this highly heritable disease is crucial to advancing research on autism. Reported concordance rates among monozygotic twins range from 60% &#8722; 90% and heritability of autism has been estimated to be 90% or greater.

Every year in the USA, 32,000 individuals are born with CV malformations; approximately 20% die during the first year of life. Another 30,000 young people develop a disturbance of cardiac rhythm or conduction. In addition, the life expectancy of another 40,000 young people is shortened by other forms of CV disease. It is becoming more apparent that in spite of the success in diagnosis and treatment, very little is known about the causes of CV disease in the young; understanding the causes will permit insight into the pathophysiologic basis of disease and allow definition of disease risk - two critical elements for disease prevention.

Results of epidemiologic studies performed through our center demonstrate that eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disease is not an uncommon entity. While the epidemiology of eosinophilic esophagitis has not been thoroughly studied until recently, there appears to be a significant increase in the diagnosis of EE in the last decade. Based on our research, this mainly reflects increased disease recognition, but there is also a bona-fide increase in disease incidence which coincides with the increasing incidence of asthma and allergic diseases in the industrialized world. In addition, many patients with intractable symptoms thought in the past to represent atypical GERD or other disorders are now being recognized as having EE. Diagnosis of EE requires endoscopy and biopsies to document the characteristic histologic findings of esophageal eosinophilia.

The goal of the research study is to identify genes harboring causative HSCR mutations and to better understand the complex inheritance of HSCR in families using whole genome mapping and sequencing studies with functional follow-up of candidate genes and variants. We intend to ascertain the frequency with which mutations in any human gene lead to familial and isolated forms of HSCR. Clinical information is collected to allow investigation of possible genotype - phenotype correlations.</p> <p>The subject population consists of individuals diagnosed with HSCR and their unaffected relatives. Individuals/families are ascertained through support groups, web-based listings of research studies and genetic testing services, an educational study website, and referrals from genetic counselors and physicians. Blood, or tissue, samples are requested from affected individuals and their unaffected relatives.</p>	Disease, Hirschsprung;Megacolon, Congenital;Hirschsprung's Disease;Disease, Hirschsprung's;Hirschsprungs Disease;Congenital Megacolon;Aganglionosis, Colonic;Colonic Aganglionosis	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000497.v1.p1

phs000504.v1.p1	Genomic Sequencing of Medulloblastoma	90	Case Set	Agilent selected, 76bp paired end reads	Sequencing	\N	\N	\N	\N	<p>Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in children. Identifying and understanding the genetic events that drive these tumors is critical for the development of more effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Recently, our group and others described distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma based on transcriptional and copy number profiles. Here, we utilized whole exome hybrid capture and Illumina sequencing to identify somatic mutations across the coding regions of 92 primary medulloblastoma/normal pairs. Overall, medulloblastomas exhibit low mutation rates consistent with other pediatric tumors, with a median of 0.35 non-silent mutations per megabase. We identified twelve genes mutated at statistically significant frequencies, including previously known mutated genes in medulloblastoma such as <i>CTNNB1</i>, <i>PTCH1</i>, <i>MLL2</i>, <i>SMARCA4</i> and <i>TP53</i>. Recurrent somatic mutations were identified in an RNA helicase gene, <i>DDX3X</i>, often concurrent with <i>CTNNB1</i> mutations, and in the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR) complex genes <i>GPS2</i>, <i>BCOR</i>, and <i>LDB1</i>, to our knowledge novel findings in medulloblastoma and all cancer. We show that mutant <i>DDX3X</i> potentiates transactivation of a TCF promoter and enhances cell viability in combination with mutant but not wild type beta-catenin. Together, our study reveals the alteration of Wnt, Hedgehog, histone methyltransferase and now <i>N-CoR</i> pathways across medulloblastomas and nominates the RNA helicase <i>DDX3X</i> as a component of pathogenic beta-catenin signaling in medulloblastoma.</p> <p>"Reprinted from &#39;MEDULLOBLASTOMA EXOME SEQUENCING UNCOVERS SUBTYPE-SPECIFIC SOMATIC MUTATION&#39;, with permission from Nature" </p>	Medulloblastoma	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000504.v1.p1

phs000507.v1.p1	Benign Ethnic Neutropenia/Leukopenia (BEN) in African-Americans	1200	Case-Control	HumanOmniExpress	GWAS	African American	\N	\N	\N	<p>Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a clinical condition more commonly observed in African-Americans. It is characterized by a relative reduction in neutrophil count by about 1000 cells per microliter, leading to a decrease in total leukocyte count by similar decrement. Previous reports of this condition showed that there was neither higher frequency nor increased severity of infections in affected individuals. Bone marrow examinations showed normal white cell maturation; and ex vivo culture of marrow cells showed low normal or slightly reduced number of myeloid colonies. Under physiologic stress, the increases in neutrophil and leukocyte counts of BEN individuals are slightly lower, compared to normal African-Americans or Caucasians. These clinical observations suggest that BEN results from a lower &#39;set point&#39; for cell number in the marrow. Additionally, case reports of familial BEN, the persistence of BEN over many decades in the US, UK, and Africa, and the recent report of Duffy antigen and chemokine receptor (DARC) being associated with neutropenia, all suggest a strong genetic association to neutropenia/leukopenia. Our initial look into microarray analyses in a pilot trial of subjects showed that there were no significant differences in mRNA signals between BEN and normal subjects. Therefore, we are now proposing a larger study, utilizing Illumina Omni Express chips, to look for genetic associations. We have partnered with the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS), where nearly half of the cohort are African-Americans. This will be one of the few GWAS being performed in only African-Americans, and will provide valuable genetic information to link with neutropenia and possibly other conditions/diseases.</p> <p>Genotyping was performed by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR).

The primary outcome is disease-free survival and secondary outcomes are overall survival and toxicity. The study design includes comparison of two pairs of treatment regimes performed in sequence. The first randomization contrasts treatment with and without Gemcitabine (3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide(FEC)-chemotherapy, followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel(D)-chemotherapy versus 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide(FEC), followed by 3 cycles of Gemcitabine-Docetaxel(DG)-chemotherapy). The second randomization contrasts treatment with Zoledronate for two versus five years. Patients were recruited from 2005 to 2007 and a total of 3754 patients were included from 250 study sites across Germany. Genome-wide SNP microarray data and phenotype outcomes for the first phase of the study (treatment with and without Gemcitabine) are included in the GARNET (Genomics and Randomized Trials Network) pharmacogenomic study in this dbGaP submission. (The Zoledronate treatments are still underway).</p> <p>SUCCESS-A is a an open-label, multicenter, 2x2 factorial design, randomized controlled, Phase III study comparing the disease free survival after randomization in patients treated with 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide(FEC)-chemotherapy, followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel(D)-chemotherapy versus 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide(FEC), followed by 3 cycles of Gemcitabine-Docetaxel(DG)-chemotherapy, and to compare the disease free survival after randomization in patients treated with 2 years of Zoledronate versus 5 years of Zoledronate in patients with early primary breast cancer. Patients were required to have histopathological proof of axillary lymph node metastases (pN1-3) or high risk node negative, defined as: pT&#62;2 or histopathological grade 3, or age , &#8804; 35 or negative hormone receptor, but were not allowed to have evidence of distant disease. Patients were entered into the study no later than 6 weeks after complete resection of the primary tumor. No antineoplastic treatment other than surgical treatment, the defined cytotoxic and endocrine treatment, and radiotherapy was allowed prior to study entry and during the course of the study. After surgery, leading to complete resection of the invasive and intraductal components of the primary tumor, patients were randomized to one of the following two treatments for the first phase of the project (which is included in this GARNET pharmacogenomics study):</p> <p><b>AA</b>: 3 cycles of 5-Fluorouracil 500 mg/m&#178; i.v. body surface area and Epirubicin 100 mg/m&#178; i.v. and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m&#178; i.v., (FEC100), each administered on day 1, repeated on day 22, subsequently followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel 75 mg/m&#178; body surface area i.v.

Subsequent to chemotherapy, postmenopausal patients with positive hormone receptor status were recommended to be treated with Anastrozole (Arimidex&#174;) 1 mg p.o. for additional 3 years, premenopausal patients will continue Tamoxifen treatment for those additional 3 years. In addition to tamoxifen, all patients with positive hormone receptor status of the primary tumor and under the age of 40 or restart of menstrual bleeding within 6 months after the completion of cytostatic treatment or with premenopausal hormone levels as defined below were recommended to receive Goserelin (Zoladex&#174;) 3.6 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks over a period of 2 years following chemotherapy. Premenopausal endocrine status will be assumed, if the following serum levels are met: LH &#60; 20 mIE/ml, FSH &#60; 20 mIE/ml and E2 &#62; 20 pg/ml. Endocrine therapy will start after the end of chemotherapy.</p> <p>All patients with breast conserving therapy or more than 3 axillary lymph node metastases or in the following cases after mastectomy will receive adjuvant radiotherapy: T3/T4-carcinoma, T2-carcinoma &#62; 3 cm, multicentric tumor growth, lymphangiosis carcinomatosa or vessel involvement, involvement of the pectoralis fascia or a safety margin &#60; 5 mm. Radiotherapy was usually performed after the chemotherapy and parallel to the beginning of the zoledronic acid therapy.</p> <p>Initially, DNA was extracted for performing SNP microarray assays using blood collected at baseline prior to the first randomization. However, the first set of SNP microarray results indicated a quality problem with approximately 50% of the DNA samples. A majority of the problematic samples were replaced with DNA extracted from redrawn blood. The remaining problematic samples were &#39;restored&#39; using an Illumina FFPE Restoration procedure.

More than 3,500 monogenic diseases have been characterized, but clinical testing is available for only some of them and many feature clinical and genetic heterogeneity. As such, an immense unmet need exists for improved molecular diagnosis in infants. Because disease progression is extremely rapid, albeit heterogeneous, in newborns, molecular diagnoses must occur quickly to be relevant for clinical decision-making. We describe 50-hour differential diagnosis of genetic disorders by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) that features automated bioinformatic analysis and is intended to be a prototype for use in neonatal intensive care units. Retrospective 50-hour WGS identified known molecular diagnoses in two children. Prospective WGS disclosed potential molecular diagnosis of a severe <i>GJB2</i>-related skin disease in one neonate; <i>BRAT1</i>-related lethal neonatal rigidity and multifocal seizure syndrome in another infant, identified <i>BCL9L</i> as a novel, recessive visceral heterotaxy gene (<i>HTX6</i>) in a pedigree, and ruled out known candidate genes in one infants. Sequencing of parents or affected siblings expedited the identification of disease gene in prospective cases. Thus, rapid WGS can potentially broaden and foreshorten differential diagnosis, resulting in fewer empirical treatments and faster progression to genetic and prognostic counseling.</p> <p>Reprinted from Saunders et. al, Rapid Whole-Genome Sequencing for Genetic Disease Diagnosis in Neonatal Intensive Care Units.

Congenital malformations of the kidney and urinary tract are present in 3 to 7 per 1,000 births, accounting for 16% of birth defects. These malformations account for 40-50% of pediatric and 7% of adult end-stage renal disease worldwide. Among these malformations, RHD represents a severe forms of disease with profound impact on long-term renal survival. We found that a significant fraction of RHD patients have a molecular diagnosis attributable to a genomic disorder, suggesting kidney malformations as a sentinel manifestation of pathogenic genomic imbalances.</p>	Congenital Abnormalities;Chromosome Disorders;Kidney Diseases;Urologic Diseases	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000565.v1.p1

All SFTs examined exhibited an in-frame fusion transcript encoding a fusion protein containing the EGR1 interaction domain of NAB2 with the transcriptional activation domain of STAT6. Functional testing of the fusion alleles confirmed the conversion of the wt NAB2 repressor into a transcriptional activator. A range of individual fusion junctions can be detected by next-generation sequencing acro the sample set, highlighting the suitability of this method in the diagnostic characterization of SFTs.

These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects.

Four index cases were identified which harbor gene rearrangements of FGFR2 including two cholangiocarcinoma cases, a metastatic breast cancer case, and a metastatic prostate cancer case. After extending our assessment of FGFR rearrangements across multiple tumor cohorts, including TCGA, we identified FGFR gene fusions with intact kinase domains of FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 in cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung squamous cell cancer, bladder cancer, thyroid cancer, oral cancer, glioblastoma, and head and neck squamous cell cancer. All FGFR fusion partners tested exhibit oligomerization capability, suggesting a shared mode of kinase activation. Overexpression of FGFR fusion proteins in vitro induced cell proliferation, and bladder cancer cell lines that harbors FGFR3 fusion proteins exhibited enhanced susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Due to the combinatorial possibilities of FGFR family fusion to a variety of oligomerization partners, clinical sequencing efforts which incorporate transcriptome analysis for gene fusions are poised to identify rare, targetable FGFR fusions across diverse cancer types.</p>	Neoplasms;Cholangiocarcinoma;Breast Neoplasms;Prostatic Neoplasms;Urinary Bladder Neoplasms;Mouth Neoplasms	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000602.v1.p1
